This the 2024 [R-HTA Workshop](https://r-hta.org/events/workshop/2024/) was hosted by the University of Sheffield, specifically the Sheffield Centre for Health and Related Research (ScHARR), as a hybrid event between 28th June and 2nd July 2024. The title was **"R for trial and model-based cost-effectiveness analysis"** and, as those who know me might guess, I found it super exciting. What follows is a personal account of what was discussed.

# The state of R in HTA
Implementation of R in health technology assessment (HTA) is limited, but the feeling is we are on the verge of a big change. Major stakeholders, including pharma companies and regulatory bodies, are embracing R to develop increasingly accurate (and complex) models. There is growing interest in making R work through the development of Shiny applications that would allow for quick understanding of health economic models under varying circumstances. 

# The speakers
The number—and quality—of the speakers was impressive. Representatives from academia, consulting, pharma, and regulatory bodies attended. As a new entry in the HTA world, I felt this was a good introduction to who's who in R and HTA.

# The content
Presentation topics ranged from methods to introduction of new R packages, and all presentations are shared on [the event's GitHub](https://github.com/r-hta/r-hta-workshop-2024). 
I found the presentation on [calculation of healthy life expectancy](https://github.com/r-hta/r-hta-workshop-2024/blob/main/content/Methods%20for%20estimating%20Healthy%20Life%20Expectancy%20-%20LCP_Pijper_Kettle.pdf) super interesting as it opens opportunities to do cost-effectiveness analysis when you do not have QALYs.


# The future...
...certainly looks bright for R in HTA. Outstanding development will bring HTA models to relevant stakeholders in the form of Shiny applications to play with.
