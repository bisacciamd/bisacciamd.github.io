The 2024 [R-HTA Workshop](https://r-hta.org/events/workshop/2024/) was convened by the University of Sheffield, specifically hosted by the Sheffield Centre for Health and Related Research (ScHARR), as a hybrid event conducted between 28th June and 2nd July 2024. The workshop theme, **"R for trial and model-based cost-effectiveness analysis,"** addresses critical methodological developments in contemporary health technology assessment. The following presents a comprehensive account of the key discussions and findings from this significant gathering.

## Current landscape of R implementation in health technology assessment

The adoption of R programming language within health technology assessment (HTA) contexts remains constrained, though evidence suggests the field is positioned at the threshold of substantial transformation. Key stakeholders across the health economics ecosystem—including pharmaceutical organizations, academic institutions, and regulatory authorities—are increasingly embracing R-based methodologies to develop more sophisticated and accurate analytical models. 

Particular attention is being directed toward the development of **interactive Shiny applications**, which promise to enhance accessibility and interpretability of complex health economic models by enabling rapid scenario analysis and sensitivity testing under varying parametric assumptions.

## Distinguished participant representation

The workshop demonstrated exceptional calibre in terms of both participant numbers and professional expertise. Representation included delegates from diverse sectors including academic research institutions, health economics consulting firms, pharmaceutical industry, and regulatory agencies. For those entering the HTA field, this event provided valuable insight into the established networks and key contributors shaping contemporary R-based methodological development in health economics.

## Content overview and methodological contributions

The presentation portfolio had a broad scope, covering a range of topics, from novel methodological approaches to the introduction of innovative R packages specifically designed for health economic applications. All presentations have been made publicly available through [the event's GitHub repository](https://github.com/r-hta/r-hta-workshop-2024), ensuring broader dissemination of the knowledge shared.

Of personal interest was the presentation addressing [approaches for calculating healthy life expectancy](https://github.com/r-hta/r-hta-workshop-2024/blob/main/content/Methods%20for%20estimating%20Healthy%20Life%20Expectancy%20-%20LCP_Pijper_Kettle.pdf). This work presents significant opportunities for conducting cost-effectiveness analyses in contexts where quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) may not be readily available, thereby expanding the scope of economic evaluation methodologies.

## Future directions and implications

The prospects for R implementation within HTA appear increasingly promising. Anticipated developments will likely facilitate greater accessibility of HTA models to relevant stakeholders through the deployment of interactive Shiny applications, enabling more intuitive engagement with complex economic models and their underlying assumptions.

These technological advances represent a significant step toward democratizing access to sophisticated health economic modelling tools, potentially transforming how economic evidence is generated, interpreted, and utilized in healthcare decision-making processes.
