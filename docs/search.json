    "text": "Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n&lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;."

Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"

Williams, A. Dastidar, J. W. Strange, E. Sammut, T. W. Johnson and C. Bucciarelli-Ducci. European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Imaging. \nBackground\nIn approximately 5-15% of all cases of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have unobstructed coronaries on angiography. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has proven useful to identify in most patients the underlying diagnosis associated with this presentation. However, the role of CMR to reclassify patients from the initial suspected condition has not been clarified. AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the proportion of patients with suspected MINOCA, or non-MINOCA, that CMR reclassifies with an alternative diagnosis from the original clinical suspicion.\nMethods and results\nA retrospective cohort of patients in a tertiary cardiology centre was identified from a registry database. Patients who were referred for CMR for investigation of suspected MINOCA, and a diagnosis pre- and post-CMR was recorded to determine the proportion of diagnoses reclassified.A total of 888 patients were identified in the registry. CMR reclassified diagnosis in 78% of patients. Diagnosis of MINOCA was confirmed in only 243 patients (27%), whilst most patients had an alternative diagnosis (73%): myocarditis n = 217 (24%), Takotsubo syndrome n = 115 (13%), cardiomyopathies n = 97 (11%), normal CMR/non-specific n = 216 (24%).\nConclusion\nIn a large single-centre cohort of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome and unobstructed coronary arteries, most patients had a non-MINOCA diagnosis (73%) (myocarditis, TakoTsubo, cardiomyopathies or normal CMR/non-specific findings), whilst only a minority had confirmed MINOCA (27%). Performing CMR led to reclassifying patients’ diagnosis in 78% of cases, thus confirming its important clinical role and underscoring the clinical challenge in diagnosing MINOCA and non MINOCA conditions.\n\n\n\nTable and figure from EHJ Cardiovascular Imaging."

Prespecified combinations of keywords related to the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of stress CMR were used. A total of 3144 records were evaluated for title and abstract; of those, 235 articles were included in the full-text assessment of eligibility. After exclusions, 64 studies (74 470 total patients) published from October 29, 2002, through October 19, 2021, were included.\nData Extraction and Synthesis\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nDiagnostic odds ratios (DORs), sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), odds ratio (OR), and annualized event rate (AER) for all-cause death, CV death, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) defined as the composite of myocardial infarction and CV death.\nResults\nA total of 33 diagnostic studies pooling 7814 individuals and 31 prognostic studies pooling 67 080 individuals (mean [SD] follow-up, 3.5 [2.1] years; range, 0.9-8.8 years; 381 357 person-years) were identified. Stress CMR yielded a DOR of 26.4 (95% CI, 10.6-65.9), a sensitivity of 81% (95% CI, 68%-89%), a specificity of 86% (95% CI, 75%-93%), and an AUROC of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77-0.89) for the detection of functionally obstructive coronary artery disease. In the subgroup analysis, stress CMR yielded higher diagnostic accuracy in the setting of suspected coronary artery disease (DOR, 53.4; 95% CI, 27.7-103.0) or when using 3-T imaging (DOR, 33.2; 95% CI, 19.9-55.4). The presence of stress-inducible ischemia was associated with higher all-cause mortality (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.69-2.31), CV mortality (OR, 6.40; 95% CI, 4.48-9.14), and MACEs (OR, 5.33; 95% CI, 4.04-7.04). The presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was associated with higher all-cause mortality (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.99-2.47), CV mortality (OR, 6.03; 95% CI, 2.76-13.13), and increased risk of MACEs (OR, 5.42; 95% CI, 3.42-8.60). After a negative test result, pooled AERs for CV death were less than 1.0%.\nConclusion and Relevance\nIn this study, stress CMR yielded high diagnostic accuracy and delivered robust prognostication, particularly when 3-T scanners were used. While inducible myocardial ischemia and LGE were associated with higher mortality and risk of MACEs, normal stress CMR results were associated with a lower risk of MACEs for at least 3.5 years.\n\n\n\nFigure from JAMA Cardiology."

Funding influences the priority setting and breadth of coverage while reflecting the needs of several stakeholders. Various strategies have been proposed to fund healthcare, which fall into two main categories: tax-based and social health insurance (SHI)-based funding. In the present essay, I will 1) compare the design and main features of tax- and SHI-based funding schemes, 2) critically appraise their key differences, and 3) evaluate their performance under the UHC framework, with an emphasis on applied real-world examples of the use of resources, equity, and resilience."

SHI schemes, however, can achieve accessibility by providing subsidized care, despite evidence of persisting uninsurance in these systems (4). Tax-based systems predictably achieve better accessibility, especially for the poorest and sickest segments of the population."

    "text": "3. Insurers\nIn SHI-based countries where multiple agents are at play, higher expenditure is reported. Since providers in these countries operate for profit, they charge more for services, despite providing coverage to fewer people. Additionally, administrative decentralization leads to higher expenditure (6). It follows that SHI countries where a single insurance fund dominates have an administrative expenditure that is comparable to countries where tax revenues are the major financing source (6). When paralleled with SHI systems, due to a simpler organizational structure, tax-based systems have historically achieved reduced healthcare expenditure and waste (6).\nWasteful expenditure due to poor implementation of the priority setting and inefficient administration amounts to ~20% of the healthcare budget in OECD countries, and up to 40% in developing countries (7); among OECD countries, SHI systems waste significantly more (6). As a result, SHI-based countries have larger healthcare expenditures, but their population does not benefit in terms of overall health and lifespan (8) . Among OECD countries, eight countries achieve high life expectancy while keeping health expenditure comparably low (9) . In six of these (Spain, Italy, Israel, Portugal, Chile, and Costa Rica), healthcare is funded majorly by tax revenue. The remaining two countries (Korea and Slovenia) use mixed funding sources of SHI and tax revenue, possibly hinting that even running a government-based scheme in parallel to an SHI scheme may help to reduce healthcare expenditure without sacrificing outcome."

This is the case in countries like Italy (10,11) and the UK (12,13), where political decisions such as increased decentralization and Brexit affected healthcare system performance in the last decade, particularly by hampering workforce planning; this is often tackled by hiring agency workers at the expense of quality of care and reliability (11,14,15). Tax-funded schemes in Europe have also been criticized for their inert bureaucracy (16) that appears resistant to the «information revolution» and has caused delays in the adoption of novel technologies and services. However, the political discourse around healthcare has also demonstrated the potential to improve public participation; in Thailand, where three-quarters of the population receive UHC through a tax-based fund (1), participatory governance through consistent citizen involvement led to improved access to quality care (17)."

Providers\nIn tax-based systems, little competition is present between providers (2), which may be seen as a disadvantage over SHI-funded schemes, where the regulations on competition may allow for widespread, affordable coverage. However, there is evidence that aiming for increased competition may affect population health in unexpected ways. In 1991, the UK NHS was the subject of a reform aimed at increasing provider efficiency, the «NHS internal market». In this system, hospitals were encouraged to reduce waiting times and overall price-for-service. This was later shown to have a detrimental effect on the health outcomes of patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (18). Quasi-private reforms are thus seen as ineffective and reduced competition may be seen as a structural feature of tax-based systems."

On the other hand, in SHI-based countries, queues are not a major issue, and health policy aims to control the larger healthcare spending. To do so, price schedules are utilized, although these may produce clinical distortions by inducing or aggravating a prominence effect (20) on physicians."

    "text": "1. Cost-effectiveness\nUHC promotes efficient use of resources through the exclusion of ineffective services and expansion of high-value care, in an effort to maintain healthcare expenditure at a sustainable level. Evidence from low- and middle-income countries (25) shows that healthcare funding based on tax revenue is a major determinant of UHC progress. This finding was later confirmed in OECD countries, where the promotion of cost-effective services – and, consequently, progress towards UHC – depends largely on the underlying funding scheme, even after accounting for a country’s gross domestic product and socioeconomic gaps, a retrospective analysis showed (26).\nBy observing OECD countries transitioning from a tax- to an SHI-based system, A. Wagstaff demonstrated that the adoption of an SHI scheme increased health expenditure by as much as 4% (3) (Figure 4); increased expenditure not only did not reduce attributable mortality but came at the cost of reduced employment rates – by up to 10% in the healthcare sector. This builds on the concept that employers might be discouraged from hiring new workers in SHI-funded systems. Another important point regarding the cost-effectiveness of healthcare systems is effective resource utilization. As previously pointed out, health expenditure is wasted more in OECD countries with an SHI scheme in place (6), in relation to the multiplicity of providers offering similar services in a decentralized fashion and at greater administrative costs (7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Outcomes in OECD countries transitioning from tax-based to SHI-based schemes.

Health equity\nUHC mandates a primary focus of healthcare systems on the disadvantaged, poor, and rural segments of the population, as these are most likely to benefit from improved access. SHI schemes, however, prioritize coverage for formal workers, to later expand to informal workers and the unemployed; thus, SHI schemes are in open contrast with UHC’s equity principle (21). SHI-based schemes are also affected by adverse selection, whereas risk adjustment strategies are detrimental to the sickest by overestimating their risk of future disease (27).\nOn the other hand, tax-based schemes are not free from threats to equity. In a resource-constrained healthcare system, queueing as a consequence of rationing should not affect patients with severe diseases or urgent presentation. Instead, socioeconomic inequalities in access to care were observed in the Italian national health service (19), so longer waiting times would be experienced by those with reduced ability to pay."

A systematic review of evidence from 133 countries showed that SHI funding was a significant predictor of increased catastrophic spending (29). The authors concluded that to reduce out-of-pocket pay, countries should increase prepayments, especially channeled through taxes and mandatory contributions. Low financial protection has an interplay with reduced health equity, as 100 million people worldwide are pushed into extreme poverty each year, facing poorer health outcomes as a result (7)."

Under stressful circumstances, resilient health systems maintain performance and prevent individual financial hardship while minimizing service disruptions and system costs. This is achieved through preparedness and dynamic adaptation (31). In comparison with pre-pandemic years, government-based schemes in OECD countries increased healthcare expenditure by an average of 26% per year in 2019-2021 (9). Spending growth was greater in countries with SHI (9), possibly because in these countries, governments with limited purchasing roles in healthcare had to shoulder significant responsibilities during the pandemic.\nEven SHI-based countries with apparently strong healthcare systems were less resilient during the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic (32). This resulted from more fluctuating, economy-dependent service coverage, which mostly affected the poorer segments of society – again, in contrast with the UHC principle to protect the poor and sickest. As a result, these countries have suffered greater social pressure, morbidity, and mortality (31). However, it should be noted that funding is only one of several determinants of health system resilience (33), which also include effective governance, health service delivery, workforce, public health function, and technologies, along with achieving community engagement."

The authors stated that to protect people from catastrophic out-of-pocket payments, what is needed is to increase «the share of total health expenditure that is prepaid», especially «through taxes and mandatory contributions». In other words, to shift towards tax-funded health systems would lead to broader coverage and better population health (24)."

Current Problems in Cardiology. \nBackground\nWhether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor is debated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the CV morbidity and mortality related to NAFLD in the general population, and to determine whether CV risk is comparable between lean and non-lean NAFLD phenotypes.\nMethods and results\nWe searched multiple databases, including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, for observational studies published through 2022 that reported the risk of CV events and mortality. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality, CV mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were assessed through random-effect meta-analysis. We identified 33 studies and a total study population of 10,592,851 individuals (mean age 53+/-8; male sex 50%; NAFLD 2, 9%). Mean follow-up was 10+/-6 years. Pooled ORs for all-cause and CV mortality were respectively 1.14 (95% CI, 0.78-1.67) and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.57-2.23), indicating no significant association between NAFLD and mortality. NAFLD was associated with increased risk of MI (OR 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.7), stroke (OR: 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1), atrial fibrillation (OR: 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3), and MACCE (OR: 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2). Compared with non-lean NAFLD, lean NAFLD was associated with increased CV mortality (OR: 1.50; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0), but similar all-cause mortality and risk of MACCE.\nConclusion\nWhile NAFLD may not be a risk factor for total and CV mortality, it is associated with excess risk of non-fatal CV events. Lean and non-lean NAFLD phenotypes exhibit distinct prognostic profiles and should receive equitable clinical care.\n\n\n\nFigure from Current Problems in Cardiology."

Heart. \nAbstract Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) defines a heterogeneous group of atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic conditions, causing myocardial injury in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Unveiling the mechanisms subtended to the acute event is often challenging; a multimodality imaging approach is helpful to aid the diagnosis. Invasive coronary imaging with intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography should be used, when available, during index angiography to detect plaque disruption or spontaneous coronary artery dissection. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance has instead a key role among the non-invasive modalities, allowing the differentiation between MINOCA and its non-ischaemic mimics and providing prognostic information. This educational paper will provide a comprehensive review of the strengths and limitations of each imaging modality in the evaluation of patients with a working diagnosis of MINOCA.\n\n\n\nFigure from Heart (BMJ)."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Heart transplantation is the treatment of choice in select patients with advanced heart failure. Since its introduction in the early 1970s, it has delivered significant benefits in survival and quality of life of these patients. However, despite significant progress in the selection of patients, technical aspects of the procedures and long-term outcomes, HT recipients face a significant risk of future complications, namely graft rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy, which warrant regular invasive monitoring with cardiac catheterisation. Stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (stress CMR) is recommended in the international guidelines in class I in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, but its role in post-HT surveillance is yet to be established. We sought to assess the safety and feasibility profile, as well as the diagnostic and prognostic yield and the overall clinical utility of quantitative stress CMR in HT recipients referred for assessment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV).\nMethods: A retrospective study of all orthotopic HT recipients undergoing clinically indicated stress perfusion CMR with adenosine was conducted. The safety and feasibility profile was demonstrated by evaluating any adverse events during or immediately following adenosine infusion and the elicited change in haemodynamic parameters. The diagnostic endpoint was area under the curve (AUC) for angiography-defined graft vasculopathy. The utility endpoint was the net benefit purported by undergoing stress CMR as a gatekeeper to angiography at a prespecified threshold range (10-40%). The prognostic endpoint was time to occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event (unplanned cardiac hospitalization or death from any cause).\nResults: 60 HT recipients were identified having stress CMR and angiography. Prevalence of CAV was 30%. Adenosine stress CMR was safe with no serious adverse events noted. Myocardial perfusion reserve index had an AUC for significant CAV of 0.79, with sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 70.3%, positive predictive value of 52.2% and negative predictive value of 92.9% at a Youden threshold of 2.1. A total of 11 patients experienced MACE at a median follow-up of 1.8 years. Myocardial perfusion reserve index, along with stress MBF, was a significant risk predictor. As a gatekeeper to invasive testing, stress CMR with quantitative perfusion showed superior decisional performance than stress CMR alone, allowing as much as 39% of patients to properly avoid angiography.\nConclusions: Stress CMR with quantitative perfusion showed excellent safety and feasibility in HT recipients, and superior accuracy, prognostic yield and decisional performance than stress CMR alone. These findings warrant prospective confirmation."

    "text": "Outline\nStress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) perfusion imaging is recommended in international guidelines as class I in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease1, and is a promising non-invasive technique for the detection of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) of cardiac transplantation recipients2. Yet, there are concerns regarding the use of vasodilators after heart transplantation3. Further, the clinical utility of stress CMR in cardiac transplantation recipients has not been formally investigated. Finally, the comparative diagnostic accuracy and prognostic yield of fully quantitative versus qualitative stress perfusion CMR in cardiac transplantation have not been previously established. Accordingly, we aimed to assess 1) the safety and feasibility profile, 2) the diagnostic and prognostic yield, and 3) overall clinical utility of adenosine stress CMR perfusion in HT recipients with suspected CAV. This thesis comprises three parts. In chapter 1, a literature review is presented on the contemporary use and outcomes of heart transplantation, and current strategies for quality optimisation in long-term CAV surveillance are briefly outlined. Results of a systematic review on use of stress CMR after heart transplantation are presented. In chapters 2–3, the methods and findings of the study are shown. In chapters 4–6, results are discussed and put into the broader context of research on post-transplantation surveillance; study limitations are addressed, and future developments proposed. Finally, the Appendix addresses some open queregarding the haemodynamic response to pharmacological vasodilation in the transplanted heart, and its implications for the measurement and clinical value of myocardial blood flow."

    "text": "Cardiac transplantation\nCardiac transplantation is the selected destination treatment in patients with advanced heart failure4. This procedure, introduced in the late 1960s and originally looked upon with skepticism and suspicion, offers unparalleled improvement in both prognosis and quality of life in patients with ongoing symptoms, its use increasing over time and with improving outcomes5 (Figure 1). Patients referred for cardiac transplantation are required to undergo a significant amount of preprocedural testing4 aimed at identifying potential contraindications. Patients deemed fit for transplantation typically undergo orthotopic heart transplantation, in which the native ventricles and all cardiac valves are excised, and anastomoses are created between the atria, aorta, and pulmonary valves of the donor and the recipient; in contrast, in patients undergoing heterotopic heart transplantation, the recipient heart is left in place and connected to the donor heart. As short-term survival improves (~85-90% at 1 year, and 75% at 5 years5), a growing number of patients are now followed up well beyond the 10th, 20th, or even 30th year since transplantation, which require extensive follow-up for the prevention of long-term complications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Rate of heart transplants worldwide, 2011-2022 (Global Observatory on Donation and Tranplantation, adapted).\n\n\n\n\nComplications following cardiac transplantation\nNotwithstanding the inherent risks of cardiac surgery, heart transplantation recipients are at risk of early- and late-onset complications, which will be briefly outlined (Figure 2). Cardiac allograft vasculopathy, a late-onset complication, will be discussed in detail in a separate section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Main complications following cardiac transplantation.\n\n\n\nIn the early days up until the first years following cardiac transplantation, the graft recipient is at risk of developing heart failure and acute rejection, which is the leading cause of death in this period. Immunosuppressive therapy which is required for control of the immune response leads to opportunistic infections which typically occur between 30 days and the first year from the procedure. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is commonly found in patients at &gt; 2 years from transplantation and is partially addressable with pharmacological treatment. Other late complications of cardiac transplantation include malignancies – mainly as a consequence of viral infections, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the onset of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression and anxiety, gout, and osteoporosis6.\n\nPrimary graft dysfunction\nThis is defined as the failure of graft function in the first 24 hours after transplantation, which is not caused by concomitant rejection, pulmonary hypertension or procedural complications. Primary graft dysfunction has variable incidence (rates of 3-28% have been reported4) and is associated with poor short-term survival. It manifests itself with diastolic dysfunction and a restrictive pattern, associated with atrioventricular and aortic valve regurgitation which is typically asymptomatic.\n\n\nGraft rejection\nRejection caused by activation of the recipient immune system, and categorised as antibody- or cell-mediated based on the predominant component in the immune response. While cell-mediated rejection occurs acutely in the first after transplantation, antibody-mediated rejection may be developed later on. Incidence of rejection is estimated at 13% in the first year since discharge, and it is recognized a major contributor to mortality7 in the first three years from transplantation. Detection of rejection requires patients to regularly undergo endomyocardial biopsy, and histological grading is based on criteria proposed by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT)8.\n\n\nInfections\nAs a consequence of the use of immunosuppressive therapy, infections are the first cause of death between 30 days and 1 year since transplantation9. After the first year, immunosuppression is typically gradually decreased, but infections remain among the top three causes of death in the long term, with an attributable mortality of &gt; 10%7.\n\n\nOther late complications\nNew onset of a malignancy following cardiac transplantation is estimated at 11% between 1 and 5 years from the procedure4 and is mainly related to viral infections from agents such as the human papilloma virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpes virus 8. Other common late-onset complications include diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and renal dysfunction, as well as psychological disorders, gout, and osteoporosis6.\n\n\n\nCardiac allograft vasculopathy\nCardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) has been labelled the «Achilles heel» of cardiac transplantation10. It consists in the diffuse intimal thickening and luminal narrowing in the coronary tree, possibly leading to focal occlusion and heart failure, with no or limited development of new collateral vessels11. Patients with CAV are often asymptomatic due to graft denervation2,11, and both epicardial12 and microvascular disease13 were separately found to be prognostic. CAV is believed to be the result of an interplay of immunological and non-immunological factors which contribute to lipid deposition and proliferation of smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the intima2 of both epicardial vessels and the coronary microcirculation (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Typical atherosclerosis and allograft vasculopathy. (Adapted from Avery 20039)\n\n\n\nRisk of CAV is associated with graft age, with incidence estimated at 8% at 1 year and 47% at 10 years4. The Stanford classification for CAV is descriptive of the morphological features at angiography. It distinguishes discrete lesions (type A) from distal diffuse concentric narrowing in main vessels (type B) or distal branches (type C)11. CAV grading is based on criteria proposed by the Cardiac Transplant Research Database, a multicenter registry that collected data from 4,637 invasive angiograms across 39 institutions in the 1990s14. This grading has been embraced by the ISHLT10, and defines CAV as pictured in Figure 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: CAV grading according to the ISHLT.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, CAV should be managed in light of the clinical context. Rapidly progressing CAV in the first 2 years since transplantation is believed to be mainly driven by vasculitis and should be managed more aggressively due to its poor prognosis. Instead, a later (&gt; 2 years) presentation in the presence of preserved graft function is typical of an indolent course. Finally, rapidly progressive CAV is defined as new-onset CAV within 1 year of a previous normal angiogram; this is also associated with poor prognosis10.\nDue to the diffuse involvement of the coronary tree, revascularization is rarely an option in patients with significant (i.e. moderate or severe) CAV15 and is ultimately considered a palliative treatment with no survival benefit16. However, pharmacological treatment has been proven useful to hamper disease progression. Use of pravastatin reduced progression in intimal thickening in an open-label, randomized clinical trial17. Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin such as sirolimus have also shown to reduce CAV progression18.\n\nEstablished and proposed strategies for CAV surveillance\nSeveral single-modal or multimodal imaging strategies have been proposed for CAV detection and surveillance following cardiac transplantation. The benefits and drawbacks for each modality will be briefly outlined; a subsequent, specific section will discuss use of stress CMR imaging.\n\nInvasive coronary angiography (ICA)\nDue to the extensive evidence available for its use, ICA is considered the gold standard for CAV detection10. ICA is highly accessible to both pediatric and adult patients. However, routine, repeated use of invasive coronary angiography for CAV detection since the first years following cardiac transplantation has long been questioned15,19,20. Arguments against the use of invasive coronary angiography include the immediate risk of harm and radiation exposure, the palliative nature of revascularization – CAV being a diffuse, slowly progressing disease – along with the reported reduced sensitivity when compared with other techniques, notably intravascular ultrasound21. Despite these considerations, ICA remains the recommended procedure for CAV detection and surveillance.\n\n\nIntravascular ultrasound (IVUS)\nUse of IVUS has long been investigated in the transplant outpatient setting22, helping to shed light on CAV pathophysiology10. The 2010 ISHLT statement on CAV shared consensus that IVUS is most useful for its negative predictive value10. Additionally, despite recognizing its high sensitivity, the panel deemed use of IVUS as «investigational» and advocated that ICA should be instead used to guide patient management. However, IVUS has been showed to effectively select patients benefiting from subsequent routine invasive angiography23.\n\n\nDobutamine stress echocardiography\nEchocardiography with dobutamine stress was found to be prognostic24 and predictive of CAV25 among heart transplant recipients, with impairment in strain parameters observed even in the presence of mild CAV26. However, when compared to CTCA against a reference of ICA, it was shown to be less sensitive27; later on, larger studies were conducted showing variable accuracy28–30 which culminated in a systematic review and meta-analysis finding highly variable sensitivity and variable specificity31. Authors concluded that the modality would be unlikely to yield enough positive and negative predictive value to effectively gatekeep patients to angiography.\n\n\nPositron emission tomography and single photon emission CT\nPositron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission CT (SPECT) are perfusion imaging modalities variably implemented in the follow-up of cardiac transplantation. Quantification of MBF by PET was diagnostic for CAV32 and prognostic at mid-term follow-up33. A later study showed superior discriminative ability of MPR over stress MBF34. Similarly, SPECT was found to be diagnostic against ICA35, but later reports found very low (&lt; 10%) sensitivity36 and overall unacceptable accuracy37, warranting against use of SPECT to gatekeep angiography. Finally, a SPECT system utilizing cadmium-zinc-telluride crystals, allowing for direct measurement of MBF and MPR, was recently validated against PET in heart transplant recipients38, but the clinical utility of such technological advance remains unestablished39.\n\n\nCTCA\nTo date, several studies have assessed the diagnostic value of CTCA for CAV detection. Upon comparison with coronary MR angiography, it showed superior performance40, and protocols with low radiation burden were validated in transplant recipients41–43. In a longitudinal outcomes study, a strategy of CTCA appeared safe and feasible in retrospect44 and use of the modality gained momentum45,46, despite the lack of high-level evidence (e.g. randomized trials, prospective comparative trials). Upon diagnostic meta-analysis, CTCA yielded high accuracy, with sensitivity and specificity &gt; 90% for 64-slice CTCA47. In a study on real-world implementation, CTCA granted excellent image quality in heart transplant recipients, however, in 25% of patients the scan was not deemed safe due mainly to renal impairment48. Notably, the literature on accuracy of CTCA mainly focused on epicardial CAV with ICA as the reference test, and no comparative studies assessed the modality against IVUS. A recent study49 evaluated the combination of anatomical assessment of CTCA with CT-based myocardial perfusion imaging, showing feasible microvascular evaluation with CT. Overall, the literature on CTCA for CAV showed safety and feasibility with some remaining concerns of real-world application. Additionally, use of CTCA for CAV surveillance would require a separate test for detecting allograft rejection.\n\n\n\nCMR for CAV surveillance\nWe conducted a systematic literature review to appraise the investigation of CMR in the follow-up of heart transplant recipients (PROSPERO: CRD42023435640). Over the last two decades, several studies have evaluated CMR in the context of allograft rejection50–62 and CAV63–74. In total, 15 studies were identified regarding use of CMR in CAV (Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\nSample size\nCMR module(s)\nMain Reference\nMain finding\n\n\n\n\nMuehling et al., 200375\n27\nStress perfusion (semi-quantitative)\nICA\nMPR index significantly decreased in heart transplant recipients compared with healthy controls\n\n\nKorosoglou et al., 200963\n69\nStrain, stress perfusion (semi-quantitative)\nICA\nMPR, diastolic strain rate have high accuracy*\n\n\nNunoda et al., 201040\n22\nWhole-heart MR angiography\nICA\nMR angiography has limited sensitivity\n\n\nColvin-Adams et al., 201164\n68\nStress perfusion (qualitative)\nICA\nVisual assessment has limited sensitivity\n\n\nMachida et al., 201267\n38\nCine, LGE\nIVUS\nCAV associated with LV diastolic dysfunction\n\n\nHussain et al., 201366\n24\nVessel wall LGE\nIVUS\nVessel LGE associated with IVUS-derived intimal measures\n\n\nMachida et al., 201365\n46\nCine, LGE\nIVUS\nLV peak filling rate accurate to detect CAV\n\n\nBraggion-Santos et al., 201468\n132\nCine, LGE\nICA\nLGE may guide risk stratification in suspected CAV\n\n\nMiller et al., 201454\n48\nCine, stress perfusion (fully quantitative), parametric mapping\nIVUS\nMPR outperforms ICA for CAV detection on IVUS\n\n\nMirelis et al., 201570\n8\nStress perfusion (semi-quantitative)\nIVUS\nMPR index detects microvascular dysfunction\n\n\nChih et al., 201632\n29\nStress perfusion (semi-quantitative)\nIVUS\nMPR index inversely correlated with maximal intimal thickness, has high rule-out ability\n\n\nErbel et al., 201672\n63\nStrain, stress perfusion (semi-quantitative)\nIVUS, biopsy\nMPR index correlated with microvessel luminal radius, detects high-risk patients with no overt CAV\n\n\nNarang et al., 201876\n20\nStress perfusion (semi-quantitative)\nICA\nMPR index associated with severity of CAV\n\n\nDeSa et al., 202073\n20\nStress perfusion (semi-quantitative)\nICA\nMPR index associated with presence of CAV\n\n\nvan Heeswijk et al., 202077\n20\nLGE, parametric mapping\nICA, OCT, biopsy\nIntima-media thickness ratio associated with increased fibrosis burden on biopsy and extracellular volume fraction on CMR\n\n\nAbbasi et al., 202274\n77\nCine, parametric mapping\nICA\nPatients with any CAV (grade 1-3) show reduced LV ejection fraction, increased global and segmental T2 values\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Studies evaluating the use of CMR for CAV surveillance.\n\n\n\nOver the course of 20 years, 15 studies evaluated the use of various CMR components to adjudicate presence or severity of CAV.

    "text": "Methods\n\nDesign\nThis was a retrospective observational study of all outpatients under surveillance for CAV after orthotopic cardiac transplantation at a large tertiary center (Harefield Hospital, London, United Kingdom), in which stress CMR was clinically indicated by the referring cardiologist. The study included a cross-sectional comparison between stress CMR results and the closest angiographic study findings (ICA or, when unavailable, CTCA), as well as a longitudinal component with follow-up for major adverse cardiovascular events. This study received approval of the local institutional review board at Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals, Guys’ & St Thomas NHS Trust. Patient informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study, which did not affect patient management in any way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Study flow chart.\n\n\n\nCMR studies performed on orthotopic heart transplant recipients at Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals between 2015 and 2023 were included if the patient had undergone a complete adenosine stress perfusion CMR study of diagnostic quality. N = 70 stress CMR studies were performed on 60 individual patients; for analyses other than the safety profile, only the index study was considered.\n\n\nStudy cases\nAll stress CMR studies conducted at Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals between 2015 and 2023 were reviewed, and orthotopic cardiac transplantation outpatients were included if they underwent a complete stress perfusion CMR study deemed of diagnostic quality, with adenosine as the vasodilator. For the safety analysis, all eligible studies were included, whereas for other analyses the index stress CMR study was included and all subsequent stress CMR studies discarded. For each study patient, baseline characteristics were collected, including age, sex, BMI, BSA, cause for transplantation, date of transplantation and graft ischemic time, along with presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoker status, chronic kidney disease, thyroid dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tricuspid regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or other atrial arrhythmias, history of venous thromboembolism, history of pacemaker/defibrillator implantation, autoimmune diseases, anxiety and depression at the time of the stress CMR study. Use of immunosuppressant or other cardiac medications at time of CMR was also noted.\n\n\nProcedures and tests\n\nCMR\nThe multi-parametric CMR (1.5 Tesla Siemens Sola scanner; Erlangen, Germany) protocol for CAV assessment comprised adenosine stress perfusion, rest perfusion, cine imaging for LV function and early (EGE) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). CMR data were analysed by level-2 or level-3 readers, using visual analysis according to the standard AHA/ACC 17-segment model. For visual interpretation of the perfusion study («qualitative» stress CMR), motion corrected images were utilized where available, and significant ischemia was reported in the presence of a stress-induced perfusion defect comprising at least 1.5 segments. An automated in-line quantitative perfusion mapping algorithm was utilized to derive global and segmental values for stress and rest myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) («quantitative» stress CMR)78. Global values for stress and rest MBF in mL/min/g, and MPR were collected. Rest MBF and MPR were then indexed to the rest rate-pressure product (heart rate · systolic blood pressure, both collected at baseline). The rate-pressure product is an index of haemodynamic response which has been linked to myocardial oxygen consumption79 and is utilized in nuclear imaging studies to account for differences in haemodynamic conditions80}, particularly heterogeneous in the context of heart transplant81}. All CMR studies were anonymized and re-analyzed specifically for the present investigation, and readers were blinded to angiographic results or other clinical information. Analysis of CMR studies was conducted on Circle CVi42 software workstations (Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc., Calgary, Canada). For each study, left and right ventricular, end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were measured, along with left ventricular, right ventricular and left atrial ejection fraction, and lateral mitral (MAPSE) and tricuspid (TAPSE) annular plane systolic excursion. Volumes were indexed to the body surface area, and LV mass was also measured. Cardiac output and cardiac index were also derived. Myocardial strain was measured with global longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strain. Presence of LGE was assessed visually and, for patients with any LGE, the LGE mass was measured with the 5-SD method. LGE mass was then indexed to LV mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: CMR protocol at 1.5 Tesla.\n\n\n\n\n\nAngiography\nFor each study case, the closest angiographic study was identified and its date and findings collected. For cases where ICA was not performed, the closest CTCA was utilized as a surrogate. CAV grading was accepted as reported or, where not formally reported, derived based on aforementioned ISHLT criteria10. Significant CAV was defined as CAV grade 2 or 3, in accordance with previous findings of no significant differences in morphofunctional features between patients with no or mild CAV74, and owing to the definition of CAV grade 3, where independently of the severity of epicardial lesions, a severe disease is adjudicated in patients with LV systolic dysfunction. For patients with CAV, lesion sites and, for ICA, stent deployment were noted.\n\n\n\nFollow-up\nThe study prognostic endpoint was time to the first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), defined as unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization or death from any cause. Causes and dates for unplanned cardiovascular hospitalizations and death were ascertained from hospital electronic health records accessed until 31st December 2023.\n\n\nData collection\nAll data relevant to the present study were anonymized upon collection and uploaded on an encrypted electronic data capture server (REDCap, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, USA). Anonymized CMR data, including results from analysis of all CMR modules, were exported to .XML files. A custom-made Shiny app was developed for extracting data from .XML files and batch transfer them into database entries. Additional study data, including baseline characteristics, angiography results and at during follow-up, were searched in electronic health records and collected by authorized staff (clinical CMR fellows, Harefield Hospital). Baseline characteristics included transplant date and cause, type of heart transplant (orthotopic, heterotopic, or heart-lung), presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia at the time of CMR; smoker status, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation or other atrial arrhythmias. Blood tests at time of CMR, including creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and glycated haemoglobin, were also noted. For each study case, the closest-in-time circulating donor-specific antihuman leukocyte antigen antibodies (DSA) blood test was identified, and its date and results noted.\n\n\nStatistics\nBaseline characteristics were summarised using descriptive statistics. Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fisher’s exact test, Student’s, and Pearson’s Chi-squared test were used where appropriate. Associations between variables were assessed by linear or logistic regression. Statistical analysis was undertaken using R software, version 4.2.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) at a 5% significance level. Statistical packages utilized are detailed in the Appendix.\n\nDiagnostic accuracy\nSensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV), and area under the curve (AUC) were determined for qualitative stress CMR results and quantitative CMR parameters to detect significant CAV on index angiography (ICA or CTCA). Patients were included in the diagnostic analysis if they had complete data from both stress CMR and angiography (ICA or, when unavailable, CTCA). The Youden index was used to adjudicate proposed optimal thresholds for continuous stress CMR parameters to detect significant CAV on angiography.\n\n\nClinical utility\nDecision curve analysis was undertaken to assess for clinical utility of qualitative and quantitative stress CMR across a pre-specified range of threshold probabilities (10% to 40%) considered representative of a sufficiently wide range of clinical scenarios82. The clinical utility of each test was expressed as 1) the net benefit of undergoing CMR rather than referring the patient directly to invasive angiography; and 2) the net reduction in unnecessary angiographies performed83, both calculated at each threshold probability in the pre-specified range. Explanation of decision curves and their analysis and interpretation is offered in the Results section. To account for model overfit, ten-fold cross-validation at 25 repeats was utilized.\n\n\nPrognostic yield\nSurvival models were constructed based on CMR results and parameters, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival probabilities and compare MACE rates. The log-rank test was used to compare survival curves. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%CIs for the association between test results and MACE. Restricted cubic splines were employed to model relationships between continuous variables and HRs."

    "text": "Results\n\n\n\nOut of 12,755 stress perfusion CMR studies performed at Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals between 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2023, 70 (0.5%) were adenosine stress CMR studies performed in 60 outpatient heart transplant recipients (31.7% females) at a median of 18.278 years after transplantation (IQR 3.1-23.9); 25% of studies were conducted within the first three years post-transplantation. Median (IQR) time between CMR and angiography was 14.3 (25.4) months and time from CMR to serum testing for positivity to DSA was 36 (11-99) days.\n\nBaseline characteristics\nMedian (IQR) patient age at CMR was 52 years (35 to 60), with 41 (68%) males. Main reason for cardiac transplantation was dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 26, 53%). Hypertension was highly prevalent at 45%, while 28% had a dyslipidemia and 25% of patients had diabetes mellitus. Very few were smokers (n = 2, 3.3%). Atrial fibrillation was reported in 6.6%. None of these characteristics differed significantly between patients with no or mild CAV and patients with moderate or severe CAV.

While 46.667% had ICA results available, 53.333% only had CTCA results. Patients referred to CTCA had significantly lower incidence of CAV (61% patients with no CAV on CTCA vs 14% on ICA, p &lt; 0.001), indicating referral bias towards CTCA for low-risk patients. Still, of 28 patients with ICA available, 10 (35.7%) had non-significant CAV. Findings on ICA or CTCA for included patients are detailed in Table.\n\n\nCMR findings\nAt CMR, mean (SD) left ventricular ejection fraction was 61.7% (12.5%), with seven patients (11.7%) having an ejection fraction &lt;45%. Late gadolinium enhancement was reported in 23 (38.3%) patients, in most of which the scar burden was minimal at 2.91 (5.39) grams (2.25% as a fraction of LV mass).

During adenosine infusion, the haemodynamic response was highly variable (Figure 7). Heart rate increased from a mean ± SD of 82 ± 14 to 91 ± 18 beats per minute, while systolic blood pressure decreased from 132 ± 16 to 124 ± 14 mm Hg. Overall, 50.1% patients reported chest tightness or chest pain during infusion, 22.4% reported shortness of breath, 17.2% did not experience any symptoms and 10.3% had hot flush. Haemodynamic and symptom response were not dependent on adenosine dosage subgroup (all p-values &gt; 0.5).

Stress MBF index was normally distributed across the sample and its mean ± SD was 2.2 ± 0.7, while MPR index was not normally distributed and its median (IQR) was 2.0 (1.5 to 2.8).

Visual ischemia had sensitivity of 27.8% and specificity of 85.4%, along with a positive predictive value of 45.5% and a negative predictive value of 72.9%.\n\n\nMPR index\nOverall AUC for significant CAV was 78.8%, with sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 70.3%, positive predictive value of 52.2% and negative predictive value of 92.9% at a threshold of 2.1 based on the Youden index.\n\n\nStress MBF\nStress MBF yielded an AUC of 66.6% with sensitivity 100%, specificity 36.8%, positive predictive value of 36.8% and negative predictive value of 100%.\n\n\nRest MBF index\nAUC for the rest MBF index was 66.0% with sensitivity 91.9%, specificity 42.9%, positive predictive value of 66.7% and negative predictive value of 81.0%.\nComprehensive results are presented in Table 5. Visual assessment and a strategy based on MPR index were compared for reclassification across the range of pre-test probability of CAV (Figure 10). A quantitative approach based exclusively on the measurement of stress MPR index, where CAV would be adjudicated for MPR index ≥ 2.1, was effective at ruling-in and ruling-out CAV, while qualitative assessment of ischemia offered almost non-existent ruling-out capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUC (95%CI)\nSensitivity\nSpecificity\nPPV\nNPV\n\n\n\n\nIschemia on visual inspection\n56.6% (44.6-68.5)\n27.80%\n85.40%\n45.50%\n72.90%\n\n\nRest MBF (mL/min/g)\n60.9% (43.1-78.7%)\n64.30%\n62.20%\n39.10%\n82.10%\n\n\nRest MBF index\n66.0% (46.8-85.3)\n42.90%\n91.90%\n66.70%\n81%\n\n\nStress MBF (mL/min/g)\n66.6% (49.6-83.7)\n100%\n36.80%\n36.80%\n100%\n\n\nMPR\n75.1% (61-89.2)\n92.90%\n48.60%\n40.60%\n94.70%\n\n\nMPR index\n78.8% (64.7-92.8)\n85.70%\n70.30%\n52.20%\n92.90%\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Discriminative ability of qualitative and quantitative stress CMR parameters for detection of significant CAV on index angiography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Pre- and post-test probability of CAV based on stress CMR results, visual assessment and quantitative assessment with MPR index compared.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative stress perfusion CMR and donor-specific antibodies\nWe separately investigated the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative stress perfusion CMR in patients with a positive or negative DSA test result. These findings along with our interpretation of them are available in the Appendix.\n\n\n\nClinical utility\nThe net benefit purported by stress CMR as a gatekeeper to angiography was evaluated over a span of reasonable threshold probabilities of CAV (10-40%). In such analysis, a strategy of quantitative stress perfusion CMR guided by MPR index (angiography for MPR index &lt; 2.1, no angiography otherwise) was compared with a strategy where guidance was provided by presence of inducible myocardial perfusion defects («visual» ischemia on stress CMR). Quantitative stress perfusion CMR conferred incremental benefit over visual ischemia across the prespecified spectrum of threshold probabilities. Use of MPR index to gatekeep patients to angiography would lead to as much as 42% net reduction in unnecessary angiographies performed, independently of patient-physician preferences (Figure 11 and Table 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical utility and decision curve analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of decision curves is an increasingly supported method to evaluate the utility of newly-introduced tests over a reference standard (1). This fits in the larger debate around the importance and real-world usefulness of metrics such as test calibration, sensitivity, specificity, or area under the curve, which are considered «statistical abstractions» (1) not inherently informative of a test’s clinical value, and poorly understood by clinicians (2). The elemental building block of a decision curve is the net benefit, which captures the trade-off between a test’s true positive rate and false positive rate:\n\\[\n\\text { Net benefit }=\\frac{\\text { True positives }}{N}-\\frac{\\text { False positives }}{N}\n\\]\nAs clinicians and/or patients may be comfortable with different levels of risk before deciding to proceed with a test (i.e., pre-test risk thresholds for testing are subjective), there is not such a thing as “one-size-fits-all” risk threshold. To address this, a decision curve is created by assessing the overall advantage or benefit of a test at a range of thresholds that are considered reasonable in a clinical setting. Each point on the decision curve reflects the benefit of the test for a specific probability threshold, taking into account the diverse preferences and perspectives of clinicians and patients. Decision curves are easily interpreted in that the test that confers the greater benefit over the spectrum of threshold probabilities offers greater decisional performance.\nA test’s clinical utility can also be expressed as the net reduction in the number of unnecessary downstream tests. In the present study, we measure the net reduction in angiographies deemed unnecessary (i.e. those angiographies conducted in patients in which no CAV was found, ~ 39%) obtained by referring the patient to stress CMR.\n\nAndrew JV, Ben Van C, Ewout WS.

A strategy of QP-CMR, guided exclusively by a finding of MPR index &lt; 2.1, conferred incremental benefit over visual assessment of inducible ischemia (Table 6).

A) at a pre-test risk threshold of 10%, neither QP-CMR or visual ischemia conferred additional benefit over a referral to angiography. For risk thresholds 15-40%, a strategy of QP-CMR guidance to further angiographic testing would confer incremental benefit over visual assessment of inducible ischemia. B) for patients at intermediate (&gt; 15%) risk of CAV, a QP-CMR would reduce unnecessary angiographies by 20-42%.\n\nCorrection for overfit\nTen-fold cross-validation with 25 repeats was used to evaluate model performance after accounting for overfit. The cross-validated quantitative stress perfusion CMR model yielded similar added benefit to the original model for threshold probabilities from 15% to 40%, while benefit for patients willing to undergo angiography for risk &lt; 15% was not maintained (Supplemental Figure 1).\n\n\n\nPrognostic yield\nDuring follow-up, 9 patients underwent unplanned cardiac hospitalization and 2 died, for a total of 11 CV events recorded (18.3%) over a median (IQR) follow-up of 1.8 years (0.9 to 2.7) years.\n\nBaseline characteristics\nTraditional CV risk predictors such as age and presence of diabetes and dyslipidemia at baseline were not prognostic. Instead, presence of hypertension and a higher resting heart rate were related to higher risk of future MACE.\n\n\nStress CMR parameters\nAmong stress CMR parameters, stress MBFi and MPRi, but not qualitative assessment of ischemia, were prognostic (Table 5). Multivariable adjustment was not attempted due to the low sample size. Exploratory plotting of hazard ratios on the spectrum of stress MPR index values and stratification by MPR index for Kaplan Meier curves demonstrated that patients with an MPR index lower than 2.0 were at significantly increased risk of future MACE (Figure 12 and Supplemental Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Prognostic value of MPR index among outpatient heart transplant recipients.\n\n\n\nAt a median follow-up of 1.8 years, eleven patients incurred a MACE. MPR index was found to be a significant predictor of future MACE. A MPR index ≤ 2 was associated with increased CV risk (log-rank p = 0.022).\n\n\nOther CMR parameters\nThe prognostic value of non-stress perfusion CMR parameters was also investigated. Among these, peak global longitudinal strain was the only significant predictor of future CV events (Supplemental Table 2); other functional parameters, such as left and right ventricular ejection fraction and markers of longitudinal function, were not prognostic in this patient population, consisting mainly of outpatients with well-functioning cardiac grafts. Presence and extent of LGE were not prognostic."

    "text": "Discussion\nA 2010 consensus statement issued by the ISHLT defined ICA as a «screening tool to grossly detect the presence of CAV»10. This statement may be seen as controversial given earlier reports of limited utility of ICA in the setting of cardiac transplantation15, the radiological risk associated with repeated, typically yearly, testing, and the significant periprocedural complication rate, which is to be balanced against limited, where not not null, interventional benefit16. IVUS has been shown to yield increased sensitivity and might be used to select patients in need of closer mid-term surveillance23, but it does not address the issue of risk and requires additional expertise. It is also subject to variable local availability.\nTo date, dobutamine stress echocardiography had low diagnostic yield for CAV31. SPECT may not be considered as a diagnostic gatekeeper to ICA due to its unacceptable accuracy36, and while novel advances in MBF and MPR quantification were recently validated38, these are far from widespread clinical implementation. Potential noninvasive gatekeeper tests include CTCA, PET and stress CMR39. CTCA currently holds a central role in CAV as it allows to image the coronary arteries with great detail84. However, radiological risk is nonnegligible with CTCA as with ICA85, being especially high in young patients86 and cumulated with repeated scans, which would be recommended at a frequency of every two years in heart transplant recipients44. Despite the growing interest in tissue characterisation and CT perfusion, these remain purely investigational and evidence is lacking that CTCA might offer a “one-stop shop” for CAV surveillance and rejection. Bearing in mind that patients with a previous cardiac transplantation face significant risks for different complications, including graft rejection and CAV, it seems highly unlikely that CTCA might allow to reduce rates of utilization of endomyocardial biopsy and invasive coronary angiography; the same goes for PET, which might have high yield in CAV, but has no established value in the context of graft rejection, confers radiation exposure, and has limited worldwide availability and expertise87.\nWe now have high-level evidence from a randomized controlled trial that a CMR strategy is non-inferior to an invasive strategy of endomyocardial biopsy in the setting of graft rejection surveillance62. This raises the bar in terms of patient needs following cardiac transplantation; as we are able to prevent more and more patients from undergoing unnecessary biopsies, it appears just as reasonable to pursue diagnostic strategies that reduce unnecessary angiographies for CAV detection and surveillance. Noninvasive strategies allowing for quantification of myocardial blood flow for CAV assessment include PET32,33 and CMR69,73,88,89, with preliminary findings for SPECT90 and CT49.\nIn our study, we observed adenosine stress perfusion CMR to be safe and feasible in a substantial cohort of heart transplant recipients, with 25% stressed at &lt; 3 years from transplantation, and able to elicit adequate cardiovascular and symptomatic responses.\nWe find assessment of quantitative stress perfusion cardiac MRI as a viable, noninvasive, radiation-free alternative to angiography, which provides acceptable rule-in and excellent rule-out ability, has incremental prognostic value, and high decisional performance in a real-world outpatient population of heart transplant recipients. In particular, we found in the MPR index, as measured in-line during the scan, a single parameter which would confer operational accuracy in CAV detection, with limited added value from other parameters such as stress MBF and rest MBF index. Importantly, we confirm results from a previous, non-comparative study in which qualitative assessment of inducible myocardial ischemia had poor diagnostic value in CAV64. We build on that finding by showing not only that quantitative stress perfusion CMR has incremental value over qualitative assessment of ischemia, but also that it might lead to a major reduction in the use of ICA and CTCA, with a net benefit in terms of newly-diagnosed patients which largely outweighs any missed diagnoses and fits well within diverse decision-making frameworks. These results on the clinical utility of quantitative stress perfusion CMR do not consider the additional benefit conferred by reduction in radiation exposure, for both CTCA and ICA, and relative harm and costs of ICA. The single parameter with the greatest accuracy (~79%) was MPR index, while all other parameters at rest and stress had smaller AUCs at ~60-70%.\nWe also evaluated the prognostic value of stress CMR long-term after heart transplantation. Our results on adenosine stress perfusion CMR expand on previous work on risk prediction by qualitative regadenoson stress CMR88,91 and semi-quantitative MPR index measurement with adenosine92. In their study, Kazmirczak, Shenoy and colleagues88 showed that an abnormal stress CMR was prognostic for a composite endpoint of composite endpoint of myocardial infarction, percutaneous revascularization, cardiac hospitalization, retransplantation or death. However, they reported on prognostic yield of broad CMR assessment, comprehensive of LV function, scarring and inducible myocardial ischemia upon visual inspection. We instead report, for the first time, on the specific prognostic value of fully quantitative perfusion parameters in patients with suspected CAV. These results can be weighed against the corresponding PET literature33,34. With the present work, CMR and PET may be nominally equiparable in terms of their diagnostic and prognostic yield, but the current lack of comparative studies justifies the need for future prospective head-to-head evaluation.\nWe additionally report, for the first time to our knowledge, on a correlation between the rate-pressure product and MBF during stress, which is not observed in the general population or in the first years after cardiac transplantation76 (see Appendix). In this context, we demonstrate that such relationship is independent of the presence of CAV and might indicate the need for adjustment of the stress MBF for the stress RPP for this parameter to achieve greater diagnostic and prognostic yield. We further evaluated the influence of positivity to donor-specific antibodies on diagnostic accuracy metrics, specifically for stress rate-pressure product-adjusted stress MBF, which is found to be significantly reduced among patients with no significant CAV who are DSA-positive, hinting at possible microvascular dysfunction in relation with subclinical rejection (see Appendix).\nIn this study, quantitative perfusion was superior to qualitative stress perfusion CMR for CAV detection and patient prognostication. At present, stress CMR is infrequently utilized for CAV assessment87. Results of this study demonstrate the value of quantitative stress perfusion CMR for CAV surveillance in heart transplant recipients and warrant future validation in a prospective trial."

    "text": "Limitations\nThis study has the following limitations. The observational, single-centre, retrospective study design allowed to demonstrate the safety, feasibility and clinical potential, but not the real-world effectiveness of a strategy of stress CMR as gatekeeper to angiography, which should be the objective of future research effort; time between CMR and angiography varied significantly among patients, possibly leading to imperfect comparison between the respective findings; in this study, both ICA and CTCA findings were utilized in a composite angiographic endpoint (and accepted as reported), whereas the latest ISHLT recommendations, despite being more than 12 years old, state that CTCA cannot be seen as an alternative to ICA for its lack of accuracy in assessing branch vessels; additionally, we found evidence of selection bias in referral to ICA versus CTCA, presumably owing to the real-world physician preference of CTCA in low-risk patients; we cannot exclude a biased representation of cardiac transplantation outpatients in this cohort, as patients not undergoing CMR, the stress component of CMR, or angiography for any reason were systematically excluded; additionally, we have not addressed the issue of donor-transmitted coronary artery disease versus new-onset CAV of the graft heart; we have not fully evaluated the additional value of quantitative stress perfusion CMR parameters compared with non-stress CMR parameters; we did not assess the applicability of parametric mapping to CAV assessment, for which there is some initial evidence74; although we confirmed the prognostic value of global longitudinal strain in this cohort as previously demonstrated93, we did not formally compare the diagnostic and prognostic yield of strain and perfusion modules, specifically because this was a study of patients undergoing stress CMR with a limited number of events. The study sample was adequate for detection of differences in quantitative perfusion parameters between patients with and without significant CAV, but may be considered modest for the prognostic analysis. This is reflective of practice of the outpatient surveillance service for cardiac transplantation recipients which does not routinely or exclusively refer patients to CMR."

    "section": "Future perspectives",
    "text": "Future perspectives\nOur study results pave the way for a future prospective, multi-centre, randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that CMR-guided catheterisation is non-inferior to current angiography referral practice in terms of safety and efficacy, and leads to reduced downstream costs owing to a reduction in use of unnecessary ICA, in long-term heart transplant recipients. As different competing tests have been proposed as credible, non-invasive gatekeepers to angiography (mainly CTCA, PET, and CMR), prospective comparisons of these tests has been recommended against a diagnostic and prognostic endpoint39. Such a study design may be challenged by the slowly-progressing nature of CAV, and it is outside of the scope of the present work to indulge in power calculations or endpoint definitions. However, where a randomized controlled trial would be deemed unfeasible, quasi-randomized designs of interrupted time-series analysis and difference-in-difference studies might instead prove feasible, less costly, and possibly as informative94. Finally, methodological and implementational aspects of this proof-of-concept study will need future investigation. There is growing awareness of the need to make cardiovascular imaging increasingly sustainable from ethical, economic and environmental standpoints95. In this light, our study findings appear incomplete and should be weighed against the comparative yield and cost-effectiveness of stress CMR and other non-invasive imaging modalities in the cardiac transplant outpatient setting, which should be the object of future investigation."

    "section": "Appendix",
    "text": "Appendix\n\nStatistical software and packages\nThe thesis was compiled with R and Quarto in VS Code. R packages utilized included ggplot2, ggstatsplot, pROC, dca, dplyr, tidyr, knitr, survival, and gtsummary.\n\n\nSupplemental results\n\nRelationship between MBF and the rate-pressure product\nAdjustment of CMR-derived MBF and MPR to the rate-pressure product (RPP) is a matter of ongoing debate. The rate-pressure product is the double product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure, with both parameters typically measured at rest. Since its first introduction in 1993, the RPP was utilized for adjustment of the rest MBF96 to account for differences in baseline haemodynamic conditions across patients; it was in fact observed that the significant correlation between RPP and MBF would lose strength and significance when both parameters were measured during vasodilator-induced stress. For this reason, stress MBF was typically not normalized by the RPP. This was also the case in heart transplant recipients75. We tested for the existence of a correlation between RPP and MBF at both rest and stress in the present cohort. As exemplified by Supplemental Figure 3, Supplemental Figure 4, a stronger, significant correlation was identified between stress RPP and stress MBF, than it was found with both parameters at rest. One reason why the rationale of adjusting only the rest MBF might not entirely apply to heart transplant recipients is that these patients, besides presenting with different baseline haemodynamic conditions, also show diverse haemodynamic response to pharmacological vasodilation, possibly in keeping with the varying degree of graft reinnervation and thus, autonomic control over the implanted heart97. In their study of heart transplant recipients undergoing stress perfusion CMR published 20 years ago75, Muehling and colleagues found significant correlation between rest MBF and rest RPP, but not between these parameters at stress (personal correspondence, courtesy of Peter Kellman and Michael Jerosch-Herold). They also reported that, in contrast with healthy controls, the RPP in heart transplant recipients was reduced upon vasodilation with adenosine, rather than increased. This was not the case in this cohort. In fact, we show that the RPP modestly increased between rest and stress (10,764±2,413 to 11,309±2,627, p = 0.06 for difference; Supplemental Figure 5). Importantly, our cohort differed significantly from the one investigated by Muehling et al., since they enrolled patients between 2 and 14 years from transplantation, while in our cohort, we reported on patients with graft age ranging from &lt; 1 to &gt; 30 years, with the large majority of patients at &gt; 10 years from graft implantation. We investigated the observed heterogeneity in RPP change between rest and stress. Age and time from transplantation were not significantly associated with change in RPP (p = 0.45 and 0.92, respectively); this plausibly excludes the hypothesis that the haemodynamic response to adenosine after transplantation is explained simply by reinnervation, which remains limited and incomplete long-term after the procedure97. Instead, male sex and positivity to DSA were significant predictors of a positive change in RPP (Supplemental Figure 6, Supplemental Figure 7). Finally, stress MBF index, but not MPR index or rest MBF index, was inversely correlated with graft age, defined as the time between graft implantation and CMR (Supplemental Figure 8). The pathophysiological foundations and possible prognostic implications of such «pseudonormalization» of the RPP response on the lifetime trajectory of cardiac grafts are unknown.\n\n\nStress MBF index\nGiven our finding of a significant correlation between RPP and MBF at stress, we conducted exploratory analyses on the diagnostic yield of the stress MBF adjusted to the stress rate-pressure product. We found comparable diagnostic and prognostic yield to the more «conventional» MPR index. Stress MBF index was found to significantly discriminate patients with moderate to severe CAV from those without significant coronary disease (p = 0.014). At a diagnostic threshold of 2.2, stress MBF index had a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 55.3%, and was also prognostic (HR 0.11, 95%CI 0.02-0.54, p = 0.007).\n\n\nStress MBF index and positivity to donor-specific antibodies\nThe low specificity observed with stress MBF index indicated a high rate of false positive tests, or patients with reduced stress MBF index who had no significant CAV on the index angiography. Patients with a false positive result were similar in baseline characteristics to patients with other test results, but they had a significantly higher prevalence of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) (p = 0.029) on blood samples tested within 36 (11-99) days from the CMR study. We separately evaluated the diagnostic accuracy in patients with a negative DSA test, and found no difference in sensitivity (90.0% vs 92.9%) and a nominal increase in specificity (72.7% vs 55.3%), with an overall improvement in AUC from 0.69 to 0.80.\n\n\n\nSupplemental tables\n\n\nSupplemental figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Figure 1: 10-fold cross-validated prediction model for net benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Figure 2: Hazard ratio for MACE as a function of MPR index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Figure 3: Relationship between rest RPP and rest MBF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Figure 4: Relationship between stress RPP and stress MBF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Figure 5: The rate-pressure product at rest and stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Figure 6: Sex-specific change in rate-pressure product between rest and stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Figure 7: Change in rate-pressure product between rest and stress in patients with and without DSA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Figure 8: Stress MBF index and graft age."
