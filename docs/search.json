At present, I am studying an MSc in Health Economics, Outcomes and Management at the London School of Economics (class of 2025).\nDuring an international PhD, I have researched extensively on cardiac MRI with particular focus on its diagnostic and prognostic value in patients with angina, cardiomyopathies, and following heart transplantation.\nI am up for collaboration. Have a look at y publications, download a copy of my CV, or drop me an e-mail at bisacciagiandomenico (at) gmail (dot) com."
