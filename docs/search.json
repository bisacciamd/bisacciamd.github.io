Licordari and C. Bucciarelli-Ducci. Heart. \nAbstract Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) defines a heterogeneous group of atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic conditions, causing myocardial injury in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Unveiling the mechanisms subtended to the acute event is often challenging; a multimodality imaging approach is helpful to aid the diagnosis. Invasive coronary imaging with intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography should be used, when available, during index angiography to detect plaque disruption or spontaneous coronary artery dissection. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance has instead a key role among the non-invasive modalities, allowing the differentiation between MINOCA and its non-ischaemic mimics and providing prognostic information. This educational paper will provide a comprehensive review of the strengths and limitations of each imaging modality in the evaluation of patients with a working diagnosis of MINOCA."

    "text": "Table and figure from EHJ Cardiovascular Imaging.\n\n\n\n\nCMR Reclassifies the Majority of Patients with Suspected MINOCA and non MINOCA (2023). K. Liang, G. Bisaccia, I. Leo, M. G. L. Williams, A. Dastidar, J. W. Strange, E. Sammut, T. W. Johnson and C. Bucciarelli-Ducci. European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Imaging. \nBackground\nIn approximately 5-15% of all cases of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have unobstructed coronaries on angiography. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has proven useful to identify in most patients the underlying diagnosis associated with this presentation. However, the role of CMR to reclassify patients from the initial suspected condition has not been clarified. AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the proportion of patients with suspected MINOCA, or non-MINOCA, that CMR reclassifies with an alternative diagnosis from the original clinical suspicion.\nMethods and results\nA retrospective cohort of patients in a tertiary cardiology centre was identified from a registry database. Patients who were referred for CMR for investigation of suspected MINOCA, and a diagnosis pre- and post-CMR was recorded to determine the proportion of diagnoses reclassified.A total of 888 patients were identified in the registry. CMR reclassified diagnosis in 78% of patients. Diagnosis of MINOCA was confirmed in only 243 patients (27%), whilst most patients had an alternative diagnosis (73%): myocarditis n = 217 (24%), Takotsubo syndrome n = 115 (13%), cardiomyopathies n = 97 (11%), normal CMR/non-specific n = 216 (24%).\nConclusion\nIn a large single-centre cohort of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome and unobstructed coronary arteries, most patients had a non-MINOCA diagnosis (73%) (myocarditis, TakoTsubo, cardiomyopathies or normal CMR/non-specific findings), whilst only a minority had confirmed MINOCA (27%). Performing CMR led to reclassifying patients’ diagnosis in 78% of cases, thus confirming its important clinical role and underscoring the clinical challenge in diagnosing MINOCA and non MINOCA conditions."

Bisaccia, F. Ricci, M. Y. Khanji, A. Sorella, E. Melchiorre, G. Iannetti, K. Galanti, C. Mantini, A. D. Pizzi, C. Tana, G. Renda, A. Fedorowski, R. De Caterina and S. Gallina. Current Problems in Cardiology. \nBackground\nWhether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor is debated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the CV morbidity and mortality related to NAFLD in the general population, and to determine whether CV risk is comparable between lean and non-lean NAFLD phenotypes.\nMethods and results\nWe searched multiple databases, including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, for observational studies published through 2022 that reported the risk of CV events and mortality. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality, CV mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were assessed through random-effect meta-analysis. We identified 33 studies and a total study population of 10,592,851 individuals (mean age 53+/-8; male sex 50%; NAFLD 2, 9%). Mean follow-up was 10+/-6 years. Pooled ORs for all-cause and CV mortality were respectively 1.14 (95% CI, 0.78-1.67) and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.57-2.23), indicating no significant association between NAFLD and mortality. NAFLD was associated with increased risk of MI (OR 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.7), stroke (OR: 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1), atrial fibrillation (OR: 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3), and MACCE (OR: 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2). Compared with non-lean NAFLD, lean NAFLD was associated with increased CV mortality (OR: 1.50; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0), but similar all-cause mortality and risk of MACCE.\nConclusion\nWhile NAFLD may not be a risk factor for total and CV mortality, it is associated with excess risk of non-fatal CV events. Lean and non-lean NAFLD phenotypes exhibit distinct prognostic profiles and should receive equitable clinical care."

    "text": "Current landscape of R implementation in health technology assessment\nThe adoption of R programming language within health technology assessment (HTA) contexts remains constrained, though evidence suggests the field is positioned at the threshold of substantial transformation. Key stakeholders across the health economics ecosystem—including pharmaceutical organizations, academic institutions, and regulatory authorities—are increasingly embracing R-based methodologies to develop more sophisticated and accurate analytical models.\nParticular attention is being directed toward the development of interactive Shiny applications, which promise to enhance accessibility and interpretability of complex health economic models by enabling rapid scenario analysis and sensitivity testing under varying parametric assumptions."

It earned distinction.\nOn the path toward universal health coverage (UHC), securing adequate funding represents a key contributor to successful implementation (Figure 1). Funding influences the priority setting and breadth of coverage while reflecting the needs of several stakeholders. Various strategies have been proposed to fund healthcare, which fall into two main categories: tax-based and social health insurance (SHI)-based funding. In the present essay, I will 1) compare the design and main features of tax- and SHI-based funding schemes, 2) critically appraise their key differences, and 3) evaluate their performance under the UHC framework, with an emphasis on applied real-world examples of the use of resources, equity, and resilience."

SHI schemes, however, can achieve accessibility by providing subsidized care, despite evidence of persisting uninsurance in these systems (4). Tax-based systems predictably achieve better accessibility, especially for the poorest and sickest segments of the population."

Additionally, tax abuse or avoidance can threaten the sustainability of these systems, which may be of serious concern in countries with a limited budget for healthcare.\nSHI systems also have their drawbacks. Having employer-sponsored health insurance has been linked to job lock (5), where individuals fear losing their insurance and avoid moving jobs or retiring. SHI is also vulnerable to adverse selection (2), possibly leading to sustainability issues in the long term."

    "text": "3. Insurers\nIn SHI-based countries where multiple agents are at play, higher expenditure is reported. Since providers in these countries operate for profit, they charge more for services, despite providing coverage to fewer people. Additionally, administrative decentralization leads to higher expenditure (6). It follows that SHI countries where a single insurance fund dominates have an administrative expenditure that is comparable to countries where tax revenues are the major financing source (6). When paralleled with SHI systems, due to a simpler organizational structure, tax-based systems have historically achieved reduced healthcare expenditure and waste (6).\nWasteful expenditure due to poor implementation of the priority setting and inefficient administration amounts to ~20% of the healthcare budget in OECD countries, and up to 40% in developing countries (7); among OECD countries, SHI systems waste significantly more (6). As a result, SHI-based countries have larger healthcare expenditures, but their population does not benefit in terms of overall health and lifespan (8) . Among OECD countries, eight countries achieve high life expectancy while keeping health expenditure comparably low (9) . In six of these (Spain, Italy, Israel, Portugal, Chile, and Costa Rica), healthcare is funded majorly by tax revenue. The remaining two countries (Korea and Slovenia) use mixed funding sources of SHI and tax revenue, possibly hinting that even running a government-based scheme in parallel to an SHI scheme may help to reduce healthcare expenditure without sacrificing outcome."

This is the case in countries like Italy (10,11) and the UK (12,13), where political decisions such as increased decentralization and Brexit affected healthcare system performance in the last decade, particularly by hampering workforce planning; this is often tackled by hiring agency workers at the expense of quality of care and reliability (11,14,15). Tax-funded schemes in Europe have also been criticized for their inert bureaucracy (16) that appears resistant to the «information revolution» and has caused delays in the adoption of novel technologies and services. However, the political discourse around healthcare has also demonstrated the potential to improve public participation; in Thailand, where three-quarters of the population receive UHC through a tax-based fund (1), participatory governance through consistent citizen involvement led to improved access to quality care (17)."

Providers\nIn tax-based systems, little competition is present between providers (2), which may be seen as a disadvantage over SHI-funded schemes, where the regulations on competition may allow for widespread, affordable coverage. However, there is evidence that aiming for increased competition may affect population health in unexpected ways. In 1991, the UK NHS was the subject of a reform aimed at increasing provider efficiency, the «NHS internal market». In this system, hospitals were encouraged to reduce waiting times and overall price-for-service. This was later shown to have a detrimental effect on the health outcomes of patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (18). Quasi-private reforms are thus seen as ineffective and reduced competition may be seen as a structural feature of tax-based systems."

Additionally, queues are shown to exacerbate existing socioeconomic inequalities by rendering healthcare less accessible to the poor and sickest (19). On the other hand, in SHI-based countries, queues are not a major issue, and health policy aims to control the larger healthcare spending. To do so, price schedules are utilized, although these may produce clinical distortions by inducing or aggravating a prominence effect (20) on physicians."

Cost-effectiveness\nUHC promotes efficient use of resources through the exclusion of ineffective services and expansion of high-value care, in an effort to maintain healthcare expenditure at a sustainable level. Evidence from low- and middle-income countries (25) shows that healthcare funding based on tax revenue is a major determinant of UHC progress. This finding was later confirmed in OECD countries, where the promotion of cost-effective services – and, consequently, progress towards UHC – depends largely on the underlying funding scheme, even after accounting for a country’s gross domestic product and socioeconomic gaps, a retrospective analysis showed (26).\nBy observing OECD countries transitioning from a tax- to an SHI-based system, A. Wagstaff demonstrated that the adoption of an SHI scheme increased health expenditure by as much as 4% (3) (Figure 4); increased expenditure not only did not reduce attributable mortality but came at the cost of reduced employment rates – by up to 10% in the healthcare sector. This builds on the concept that employers might be discouraged from hiring new workers in SHI-funded systems. Another important point regarding the cost-effectiveness of healthcare systems is effective resource utilization. As previously pointed out, health expenditure is wasted more in OECD countries with an SHI scheme in place (6), in relation to the multiplicity of providers offering similar services in a decentralized fashion and at greater administrative costs (7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Outcomes in OECD countries transitioning from tax-based to SHI-based schemes.

    "text": "2. Health equity\nUHC mandates a primary focus of healthcare systems on the disadvantaged, poor, and rural segments of the population, as these are most likely to benefit from improved access. SHI schemes, however, prioritize coverage for formal workers, to later expand to informal workers and the unemployed; thus, SHI schemes are in open contrast with UHC’s equity principle (21). SHI-based schemes are also affected by adverse selection, whereas risk adjustment strategies are detrimental to the sickest by overestimating their risk of future disease (27).\nOn the other hand, tax-based schemes are not free from threats to equity. In a resource-constrained healthcare system, queueing as a consequence of rationing should not affect patients with severe diseases or urgent presentation. Instead, socioeconomic inequalities in access to care were observed in the Italian national health service (19), so longer waiting times would be experienced by those with reduced ability to pay."

Financial protection\nDespite significant advances in the previous 20 years, rates of catastrophic health spending are now increasing worldwide as progress toward UHC has halted since 2015 (28). A systematic review of evidence from 133 countries showed that SHI funding was a significant predictor of increased catastrophic spending (29). The authors concluded that to reduce out-of-pocket pay, countries should increase prepayments, especially channeled through taxes and mandatory contributions. Low financial protection has an interplay with reduced health equity, as 100 million people worldwide are pushed into extreme poverty each year, facing poorer health outcomes as a result (7)."

Under stressful circumstances, resilient health systems maintain performance and prevent individual financial hardship while minimizing service disruptions and system costs. This is achieved through preparedness and dynamic adaptation (31). In comparison with pre-pandemic years, government-based schemes in OECD countries increased healthcare expenditure by an average of 26% per year in 2019-2021 (9). Spending growth was greater in countries with SHI (9), possibly because in these countries, governments with limited purchasing roles in healthcare had to shoulder significant responsibilities during the pandemic.\nEven SHI-based countries with apparently strong healthcare systems were less resilient during the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic (32). This resulted from more fluctuating, economy-dependent service coverage, which mostly affected the poorer segments of society – again, in contrast with the UHC principle to protect the poor and sickest. As a result, these countries have suffered greater social pressure, morbidity, and mortality (31). However, it should be noted that funding is only one of several determinants of health system resilience (33), which also include effective governance, health service delivery, workforce, public health function, and technologies, along with achieving community engagement."

The authors stated that to protect people from catastrophic out-of-pocket payments, what is needed is to increase «the share of total health expenditure that is prepaid», especially «through taxes and mandatory contributions». In other words, to shift towards tax-funded health systems would lead to broader coverage and better population health (24)."

Prespecified combinations of keywords related to the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of stress CMR were used. A total of 3144 records were evaluated for title and abstract; of those, 235 articles were included in the full-text assessment of eligibility. After exclusions, 64 studies (74 470 total patients) published from October 29, 2002, through October 19, 2021, were included.\nData Extraction and Synthesis\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nDiagnostic odds ratios (DORs), sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), odds ratio (OR), and annualized event rate (AER) for all-cause death, CV death, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) defined as the composite of myocardial infarction and CV death.\nResults\nA total of 33 diagnostic studies pooling 7814 individuals and 31 prognostic studies pooling 67 080 individuals (mean [SD] follow-up, 3.5 [2.1] years; range, 0.9-8.8 years; 381 357 person-years) were identified. Stress CMR yielded a DOR of 26.4 (95% CI, 10.6-65.9), a sensitivity of 81% (95% CI, 68%-89%), a specificity of 86% (95% CI, 75%-93%), and an AUROC of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77-0.89) for the detection of functionally obstructive coronary artery disease. In the subgroup analysis, stress CMR yielded higher diagnostic accuracy in the setting of suspected coronary artery disease (DOR, 53.4; 95% CI, 27.7-103.0) or when using 3-T imaging (DOR, 33.2; 95% CI, 19.9-55.4). The presence of stress-inducible ischemia was associated with higher all-cause mortality (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.69-2.31), CV mortality (OR, 6.40; 95% CI, 4.48-9.14), and MACEs (OR, 5.33; 95% CI, 4.04-7.04). The presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was associated with higher all-cause mortality (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.99-2.47), CV mortality (OR, 6.03; 95% CI, 2.76-13.13), and increased risk of MACEs (OR, 5.42; 95% CI, 3.42-8.60). After a negative test result, pooled AERs for CV death were less than 1.0%.\nConclusion and Relevance\nIn this study, stress CMR yielded high diagnostic accuracy and delivered robust prognostication, particularly when 3-T scanners were used. While inducible myocardial ischemia and LGE were associated with higher mortality and risk of MACEs, normal stress CMR results were associated with a lower risk of MACEs for at least 3.5 years."

Journal of Neurology. \nBackground\nCase-reports/series and cohorts of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) associated with COVID-19 vaccination have been reported.\nMethods\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies of GBS after COVID-19 vaccination was carried out. Incidence and incidence rate ratio for a number of vaccine doses and risk of GBS, also considering the specific vaccine technology, were calculated in a random-effects model.\nResults\nOf 554 citations retrieved, 518 were discarded as irrelevant. We finally included 15 studies. The random effect model yielded, regardless of the vaccine technology, 1.25 (95%CI 0.21; 2.83) GBS cases per million of COVID-19 vaccine doses, 3.93 (2.54; 5.54) cases per million doses for adenovirus-vectored vaccines and 0.69 (0.38; 1.06) cases per million doses for mRNA vaccines. The GBS risk was 2.6 times increased with the first dose. Regardless of the vaccine technology, the GBS risk was not increased but disaggregating the data it was 2.37 (1.67; 3.36) times increased for adenovirus-vectored vaccines and 0.32 (0.23; 0.47) for mRNA vaccines. Mortality for GBS after vaccination was 0.10 per million doses and 4.6 per GBS cases.\nConclusions\nAdenovirus-vectored vaccines showed a 2.4 times increased risk of GBS that was about seven times higher compared with mRNA-based vaccines. The decreased GBS risk associated with mRNA vaccines was possibly due to an elicited reduction of infections, including SARS-CoV-2, associated with GBS during the vaccination period. How adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines may trigger GBS is unclear and further studies should investigate the relationship between vaccine technologies and GBS risk."

S. Censi, G. Bisaccia, S. Gallina, V. Tomassini and A. Uncini. European Journal of Neurology. \nBackground and purpose The association between Guillain−Barré syndrome (GBS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is debated. This study reappraises, after three pandemic years, the epidemiological data and the features of GBS in SARS-CoV-2 patients.\nMethods\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of case reports/series and cohort studies published between 1 January 2020 and 19 April 2023 was performed.\nResults In all, 209 case reports/series (304 patients) and 26 cohort studies were included. The risk of GBS in northern Italy during the first pandemic wave was 2.85 times increased (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54; 5.25) whereas in some countries the risk during the first pandemic year was 0.17 times reduced (risk ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.75; 0.93). The incidence of GBS in SARS-CoV-2 Italian hospitalized cohorts was 8.55 per 1000 (95% CI 5.33; 12.49) with an estimated incidence of 0.13 GBS per 1000 in the SARS-CoV-2 infected population. In European cohorts the pooled rate of GBS with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 61.3% of the total. GBS patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection showed more frequently, but not differently from non-infected patients, the classical clinical presentation and the demyelinating subtype. Cranial nerves were more frequently involved in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\nConclusions An increased risk of GBS occurred in northern Italy during early COVID-19 pandemic. The recognition of the ‘Italian factor’ reconciles contrasting results of the epidemiological studies. The slightly reduced GBS risk in other countries and the relatively high frequency of GBS associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection can be explained by the adopted health measures that decreased the circulation of other GBS infective antecedents."

Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance. \nBackground\nExercise ECG remains widely performed in the assessment of patients with suspected cardiac chest pain. We aimed to assess the comparative diagnostic and prognostic yield of exercise ECG, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), in a large prospective patient population.\nMethods\nPatients recruited to CE-MARC who had exercise ECG were included and followed up to a median(IQR) of 6.3(0.1,6.8) years. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values, and area under the curve (AUC) for diagnostic accuracy were derived and hazard ratios of MACE for prognostic significance calculated.\nResults\nOf 752 patients in the CE-MARC trial, 580 had exercise ECG and invasive coronary angiography, of which 503 also had SPECT and CMR. At follow-up, a total of 91(15.7%) patients experienced MACE. Using invasive angiography as the reference test, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV(95%CI) of exercise ECG were 68.3(61.9,74.0), 72.5(67.6,76.9), 61.0(54.8,66.8), 78.4(73.7,82.5). Exercise ECG was significantly less sensitive than CMR and less specific than both CMR and SPECT. A positive exercise ECG result was not predictive of MACE at follow-up (HR 1.14[0.75,1.72], p=0.53). CMR had both a greater diagnostic and prognostic yield than exercise ECG, SPECT and their combination. Sequential CMR following inconclusive exercise ECG was comparable to CMR alone as the first-line test.\nConclusions\nIn patients with suspected angina, CMR alone as the first-line test was more sensitive and prognostically accurate than exercise ECG, SPECT, or sequential combination of both tests."
