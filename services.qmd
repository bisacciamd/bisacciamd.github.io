I deliver rigorous evidence synthesis and economic evaluations that inform healthcare decisions and have real-world impact. 

- My [systematic review in JAMA Cardiology](pubs/jamacard2023/index.qmd) has been incorporated into the **ESC Clinical Guidelines** and cited 18+ times. 
- My [two sister systematic reviews](https://bisacciamd.com/portfolio.html#category=Guillain-Barr%C3%A9%20syndrome) on risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome after COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination have been cited 35+ times.
- I have presented my research at 10+ international cardiovascular conferences in Europe and the USA.

**Credentials:**

- MD-PhD, G. d'Annunzio University, Italy
- MSc Health Economics, Outcomes and Management in Clinical Sciences, London School of Economics (LSE), UK (class of 2025)
- 21+ peer-reviewed publications in leading journals
- As a research officer at LSE Health, I am currently developing economic evaluation tools for EU-funded [HYPERMARKER project](https://www.hypermarker.eu/)

# Evidence Synthesis

Transform scattered research into clear, actionable insights through systematic and transparent methodology and reporting.

## Systematic Reviews
**PRISMA-compliant comprehensive evidence assessment**

- **Applications**: grant applications, clinical guidelines, competitive landscape analysis, regulatory submissions
- **Deliverables**: Protocol with PROSPERO registration, full manuscript, PRISMA flow diagram, quality assessment, evidence tables
- **Timeline**: 8-12 weeks
- See [published examples](https://bisacciamd.com/portfolio.html#category=systematic%20review)

## Meta-Analysis
**Statistical synthesis for precise effect estimates**

- **Applications**: Publications, research synthesis, demonstrating product superiority, market access dossiers
- **Expertise**: Fixed/random effects models, subgroup analysis, meta-regression, publication bias assessment
- **Deliverables**: Forest plots, funnel plots, sensitivity analyses, technical reports
- See [published examples](https://bisacciamd.com/portfolio.html#category=meta-analysis)

## Network Meta-Analysis
**Compare multiple interventions simultaneously**

- **Applications**: Treatment rankings for guidelines, indirect comparisons for HTA, competitive positioning
- **Methods**: Bayesian and frequentist approaches, consistency assessment, GRADE certainty ratings
- **Deliverables**: Network plots, league tables, SUCRA rankings, comprehensive reports

# Health Economics and Outcomes Research

Quantify value propositions and optimize healthcare resource allocation with advanced economic modeling.

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
**Full economic evaluation for decision-making**

- **Applications**: Reimbursement submissions, formulary applications, pricing strategy, policy evaluation
- **Modeling**: Markov models, decision trees, discrete event simulation, partitioned survival
- **Outputs**: ICERs, cost-effectiveness planes, acceptability curves, value of information analysis

## Budget Impact Analysis
**Real-world affordability and resource planning**

- **Applications**: Hospital formulary decisions, payer negotiations, healthcare planning
- **Capabilities**: Multi-year projections, scenario analysis, population modeling
- **Deliverables**: Excel-based models, executive summaries, presentation decks

## Survival Analysis
**Time-to-event modeling and extrapolation**

- **Applications**: Overall survival, progression-free survival, lifetime cost projections
- **Methods**: Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, parametric survival models, flexible spline models
- **Software**: R (survival, flexsurv packages)

## Decision Curve Analysis
**Clinical utility assessment for predictive models**

- **Applications**: Biomarker evaluation, risk prediction models, diagnostic test evaluation
- **Deliverables**: Net benefit curves, clinical impact plots, decision thresholds
