I deliver rigorous evidence synthesis and economic evaluations that inform healthcare decisions. My [systematic review in JAMA Cardiology](pubs/jamacard2023/index.qmd) has been incorporated into the **ESC Clinical Guidelines** and cited 17 times, demonstrating real-world impact.

**Credentials:**

- MD-PhD (University of Chieti, Italy) + MSc Health Economics (LSE)
- 21 peer-reviewed publications in leading journals
- As a research officer at LSE Health, I am currently developing economic evaluation tools for EU-funded [HYPERMARKER project](https://www.hypermarker.eu/)

# Evidence Synthesis

Transform scattered research into clear, actionable insights through systematic and transparent methodology and reporting.

## Systematic Reviews
**PRISMA-compliant comprehensive evidence assessment**

- **Applications**: PhD dissertations, grant applications, clinical guidelines, competitive landscape analysis, regulatory submissions
- **Deliverables**: Protocol with PROSPERO registration, full manuscript, PRISMA flow diagram, quality assessment, evidence tables
- **Timeline**: 8-12 weeks

## Meta-Analysis
**Statistical synthesis for precise effect estimates**

- **Applications**: Publications, research synthesis, demonstrating product superiority, market access dossiers
- **Expertise**: Fixed/random effects models, subgroup analysis, meta-regression, publication bias assessment
- **Deliverables**: Forest plots, funnel plots, sensitivity analyses, technical reports

## Network Meta-Analysis
**Compare multiple interventions simultaneously**

- **Applications**: Treatment rankings for guidelines, indirect comparisons for HTA, competitive positioning
- **Methods**: Bayesian and frequentist approaches, consistency assessment, GRADE certainty ratings
- **Deliverables**: Network plots, league tables, SUCRA rankings, comprehensive reports

# Health Economics and Outcomes Research

Quantify value propositions and optimize healthcare resource allocation with advanced economic modeling.

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
**Full economic evaluation for decision-making**

- **Applications**: Reimbursement submissions, formulary applications, pricing strategy, policy evaluation
- **Modeling**: Markov models, decision trees, discrete event simulation, partitioned survival
- **Outputs**: ICERs, cost-effectiveness planes, acceptability curves, value of information analysis

## Budget Impact Analysis
**Real-world affordability and resource planning**

- **Applications**: Hospital formulary decisions, payer negotiations, healthcare planning
- **Capabilities**: Multi-year projections, scenario analysis, population modeling
- **Deliverables**: Excel-based models, executive summaries, presentation decks

## Survival Analysis
**Time-to-event modeling and extrapolation**

- **Applications**: Overall survival, progression-free survival, lifetime cost projections
- **Methods**: Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, parametric survival models, flexible spline models
- **Software**: R (survival, flexsurv packages)

## Decision Curve Analysis
**Clinical utility assessment for predictive models**

- **Applications**: Biomarker evaluation, risk prediction models, diagnostic test evaluation
- **Deliverables**: Net benefit curves, clinical impact plots, decision thresholds

# Interactive Data Visualization

Transform complex analyses into intuitive, interactive experiences with custom Shiny applications.

## R/Shiny Dashboard Development
**Interactive tools that bring your data to life**

I create custom interactive dashboards that enable real-time exploration of:

- **Clinical Trial Data**: [Interactive sample size calculations](portfolio/rct/index.qmd) with power analysis
- **Diagnostic Test Evaluation**: [Dynamic diagnostic accuracy assessments](portfolio/dta/index.qmd) with ROC curves
- **Economic Models**: Sensitivity analysis dashboards for cost-effectiveness results
- **Evidence Synthesis**: Interactive forest plots and network visualizations

**Technical Expertise**: R/Shiny, reactive programming, custom UI/UX design, deployment to ShinyApps.io or private servers

**Deliverables**: Fully functional web applications, source code, deployment support, user documentation
