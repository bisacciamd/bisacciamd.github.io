## Quarto dashboards
### Diagnostic test assessment
A dasboard for evaluating the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of a diagnostic test against a reference standard. [{{< bi box-arrow-up-right >}}](https://nweex5-g-bisaccia.shinyapps.io/dta-dashboard/)

## MATLAB software
#### DICOM handler
A script allowing batch extraction of selected images (stress and rest perfusion, late gadolinium enhancement) from cardiac MRI studies.

### Methods
#### Diagnostic test accuracy analysis
- diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis with the split component synthesis method, as used in @RN15.

#### Survival analysis
- survival analysis with modeling of the hazard ratio on a continuous variable as in @RN31.

#### Decision curve analysis
I used this in my [PhD thesis](phd.qmd#clinical-utility-1) to evaluate the clinical utility of quantitative stress perfusion CMR to reduce use of coronary angiography in vasculopathy surveillance after heart transplantation. 

### Data visualization
#### Sankey chart
This was used in @RN21.
