   abstract = {Type of funding sources: None.Assessment of inducible ischemia with stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is recommended in patients with chest pain and intermediate or high pre-test probability of coronary artery disease (CAD). We aimed to provide a contemporary quantitative data synthesis on diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of stress CMR in patients with stable chest pain syndromes.We performed a prespecified systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published over the last twenty years on the diagnostic and prognostic value of stress CMR (PROSPERO: CRD42022299275). We measured pooled diagnostic indicators, including diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and summary effect size indicators, including odds ratios (ORs) and cumulative annualized event rates (AERs) for all-cause death, cardiovascular death and major adverse cardiac events (MACE).We identified 33 diagnostic studies pooling 7,815 individuals (mean age, 62 years, 62% males) and 31 prognostic studies pooling 67,080 patients (mean age, 62 years; 57% males; mean follow-up 3.5 years for a total of 381,357 person-years). Stress CMR yielded a pooled DOR of 26.4 (95%CI:10.6–65.9), a sensitivity of 81% (95%CI:68–89%), a specificity of 86% (95%CI:75–93%), and an AUC of 0.84 (95%CI:0.77–0.89) for the detection of functionally obstructive CAD with fractional flow reserve as the reference test. In subgroup analysis, 3 Tesla imaging yielded higher diagnostic accuracy achieving a DOR of 33.2. Presence of stress-inducible ischemia was associated with higher all-cause mortality (OR:2.0; 95%CI:1.7–2.3), cardiovascular mortality (OR:6.4; 95%CI:4.5–9.1), and increased risk of MACE (OR:5.3; 95%CI:4.0–7.0). AERs for cardiovascular death and MACE were &lt; 1% in patients without stress-inducible ischemia.Stress CMR yields high diagnostic accuracy and delivers robust prognostication in patients with stable chest pain and known or suspected CAD, particularly with 3 Tesla imaging. While inducible ischemia portends excess mortality and increased risk of MACE, a negative stress CMR indicates a very low risk of future cardiovascular events, with a warranty period of at least 3.5 years.},

   abstract = {Type of funding sources: None.This study sought to assess the role of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in investigating patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and non-obstructed coronary arteries.Consecutive patients presenting to a tertiary cardiology centre with suspected ACS and non-obstructed coronary arteries and referred for CMR were retrospectively identified. A comprehensive imaging protocol was performed to include cines, T2-weighted, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences. Final CMR diagnosis was based on established patterns of tissue characterisation from myocardial oedema and LGE imaging, with patients grouped into five: myocardial infarction, myocarditis, Takotsubo syndrome, cardiomyopathy, and a normal CMR.A total of 888 patients were identified. The mean age across the cohort was 57 years (SD ±15.9 years) with 51% female patients. Median time to CMR from acute presentation was 21 days (Figure 1). Aetiology of presentation was uncertain in more than half of patients referred for CMR (483, 54.1%). Of patients with an initial uncertain aetiology, CMR was able to identify an underlying diagnosis in 74.9%. Diagnosis across the whole cohort was reclassified in 691 patients (77.8%), with overall diagnostic yield (CMR identified underlying aetiology for presentation) of 75.6%. (Figure 2).In a large single-centre cohort of patients presenting with suspected ACS and non-obstructed coronary arteries, diagnostic yield with CMR was high at 76%. CMR reclassified nearly 80% of patients. Our results highlight the importance of CMR in the diagnostic pathway of suspected ACS and potential implications on clinical management.},
