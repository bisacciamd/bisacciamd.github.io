## Transforming Healthcare Data into Strategic Insights

I deliver rigorous **evidence synthesis** and **health economic evaluations** that inform healthcare decisions. With an MD-PhD from Italy and ongoing MSc in Health Economics at the London School of Economics, I bridge clinical expertise with health economics and data science.

### Impact That Matters

::: {style="text-align: left;"}
- In my international doctoral research (Chieti, Italy and London, UK), I have studied the diagnostic and prognostic value of cardiac MRI in patients with angina, cardiomyopathies, and following heart transplantation.
- My systematic review in [JAMA Cardiology](pubs/jamacard2023/index.qmd) has been incorporated into the 2024 **ESC Clinical Guidelines**, demonstrating translation of methodological rigour into real-world impact. 
- Currently, as a research officer at LSE Health, I'm developing economic evaluation tools for the EU-funded [HYPERMARKER project](https://www.hypermarker.eu/).
