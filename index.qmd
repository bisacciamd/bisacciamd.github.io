I am an early career medical researcher with interest in cardiology. I earned my MD (2021) and PhD (2024) from the "G. d'Annunzio" University of Chieti and Pescara, Italy.

I am primarily focused on studying the yield of non-invasive cardiovascular imaging in patients with chest pain. I presented my work at major international cardiology and imaging conferences. I have initial supervising and teaching experience. 

Have a look at my [publications](pubs.qmd) or download a copy of my [CV](cv/index.qmd).
