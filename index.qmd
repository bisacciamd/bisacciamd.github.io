I am an early career medical researcher with interest in cardiology. I earned my MD (2021) and PhD (2024) from the "G. d'Annunzio" University of Chieti and Pescara, Italy.

I am primarily focused on studying non-invasive cardiovascular imaging in patients with chest pain with diagnostic test evaluation and health technology assessment. 

I am up for collaboration. Have a look at my [publications](pubs.qmd), download a copy of my [CV](cv/index.qmd), or drop me an e-mail at bisacciagiandomenico (at) gmail (dot) com.
