I am an early career medical researcher. I earned my MD (2021) and PhD (2024) from the G. d'Annunzio University of Chieti and Pescara, Italy.

My primary research interest is in the evaluation of cardiovascular imaging modalities in ischemic heart disease. I have initial supervising and teaching experience and presented my work at several international cardiology conferences, including the European Society of Cardiology Congress (2020-2022) and American Heart Association Scientific Sessions (2023). I was a finalist in the Early Career Award clinical track at London CMR 2024.
