Passionate about evidence generation & appraisal, clinical research, and health technology, I earned my MD-PhD at the University of Chieti and Pescara, Italy. I am studying an MSc in Health Economics, Outcomes and Management at the London School of Economics (class of 2025). 

Since undertaking an international PhD (London, UK), I have researched extensively on cardiac MRI with particular focus on its diagnostic and prognostic value in patients with angina, cardiomyopathies, and following heart transplantation. At present, I am a Resident in Cardiology at my home University.
