Interpreting published results of randomized clinical trials is challenging. Communicated results often highlight certain aspects of a study while conceiling others. As a result, the final user of the trial-conceived information — the physician — is often left with few tools to actually understand what happened in a particular trial. We have evidence that physicians are generally poor at interpreting clinical research @10.1001/jama.298.9.1010.
The RCT dashboard provides basic insight into 2-arm RCT results, and can be leveraged to assess efficacy and safety of interventions. [{{< bi box-arrow-up-right >}}](https://nweex5-g-bisaccia.shinyapps.io/rct-appraise/)
