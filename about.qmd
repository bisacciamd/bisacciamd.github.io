I am an early career medical researcher. I earned my [MD (2021)](md.qmd) and [PhD (2024)](phd.qmd) from the G. d'Annunzio University of Chieti and Pescara, Italy. I am currently a student in the London School of Economics Master's in *[Health Economics, Outcomes and Management in Clinical Sciences](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2024/Executive-MSc-Health-Economics-Outcomes-Management-Clinical-Sciences)*, class of 2025. My main research interest is cardiology, particularly cardiovascular imaging. I have presented at several international cardiology conferences, including the European Society of Cardiology Congress (2020-2022) and American Heart Association Scientific Sessions (2023). I was a finalist in the Early Career Award clinical track at London CMR 2024.
