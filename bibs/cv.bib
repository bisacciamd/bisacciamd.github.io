   abstract = {In recent years, the mean survival rate of children after a cancer diagnosis has significantly improved. At the same time, a growing interest in short and long-term cardiovascular (CV) complications of cancer therapy, as well as long-term CV risk in childhood cancer survivors (CCS) developed, along with proposals of protocols for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of cancer therapy-related CV toxicity (CTR-CVT) in this population. Many clinical and individual risk factors for CTR-CVT have been identified, and a non-negligible prevalence of traditional CV risk factors has been described in this population, potentially associated with a further worsening in both CTR-CVT and long-term CV risk. Physical exercise (PE) represents a promising, free-of-cost and free-of-complications, helpful therapy for primary and secondary prevention of CTR-CVT in CCS. The present narrative review aims to summarize the most critical evidence available about CTR-CVT in CCS, focusing on the role of PE in this clinical scenario.},

   abstract = {Abstract Aortic stenosis (AS) stands as the most common valvular heart disease in developed countries and is characterized by progressive narrowing of the aortic valve orifice resulting in elevated transvalvular flow resistance, left ventricular hypertrophy, and progressive increased risk of heart failure and sudden death. This narrative review explores clinical challenges and evolving perspectives in moderate AS, where discrepancies between aortic valve area and pressure gradient measurements may pose diagnostic and therapeutic quandaries. Transthoracic echocardiography is the first-line imaging modality for AS evaluation, yet cases of discordance may require the application of ancillary noninvasive diagnostic modalities. This review underscores the importance of accurate grading of AS severity, especially in low-gradient phenotypes, emphasizing the need for vigilant follow-up. Current clinical guidelines primarily recommend aortic valve replacement for severe AS, potentially overlooking latent risks in moderate disease stages. The noninvasive multimodality imaging approach?including echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, computed tomography, and nuclear techniques?provides unique insights into adaptive and maladaptive cardiac remodeling in AS and offers a promising avenue to deliver precise indications and exact timing for intervention in moderate AS phenotypes and asymptomatic patients, potentially improving long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, what we may have gleaned from a large amount of observational data is still insufficient to build a robust framework for clinical decision-making in moderate AS. Future research will prioritize randomized clinical trials designed to weigh the benefits and risks of preemptive aortic valve replacement in the management of moderate AS, as directed by specific imaging and nonimaging biomarkers.},

   abstract = {Originally designed as anti-hyperglycemic drugs, Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Ra) and Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have demonstrated protective cardiovascular effects, with significant impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite several mechanisms have been proposed, the exact pathophysiology behind these effects is not yet fully understood. Cardiovascular imaging is key for the evaluation of diabetic patients, with an established role from the identification of early subclinical changes to long-term follow up and prognostic assessment. Among the different imaging modalities, CMR may have a key-role being the gold standard for volumes and function assessment and having the unique ability to provide tissue characterization. Novel techniques are also implementing the possibility to evaluate cardiac metabolism through CMR and thereby further increasing the potential role of the modality in this context. Aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of changes in CMR parameters and novel CMR techniques applied in both pre-clinical and clinical studies evaluating the effects of SGLT2i and GLP-1Ra, and their potential role in better understanding the underlying CV mechanisms of these drugs.},

   abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The clinical utility of stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in stable chest pain is still debated, and the low-risk period for adverse cardiovascular (CV) events after a negative test result is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To provide contemporary quantitative data synthesis of the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of stress CMR in stable chest pain. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase databases, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry were searched for potentially relevant articles from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Selected studies evaluated CMR and reported estimates of diagnostic accuracy and/or raw data of adverse CV events for participants with either positive or negative stress CMR results. Prespecified combinations of keywords related to the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of stress CMR were used. A total of 3144 records were evaluated for title and abstract; of those, 235 articles were included in the full-text assessment of eligibility. After exclusions, 64 studies (74 470 total patients) published from October 29, 2002, through October 19, 2021, were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diagnostic odds ratios (DORs), sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), odds ratio (OR), and annualized event rate (AER) for all-cause death, CV death, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) defined as the composite of myocardial infarction and CV death. RESULTS: A total of 33 diagnostic studies pooling 7814 individuals and 31 prognostic studies pooling 67 080 individuals (mean [SD] follow-up, 3.5 [2.1] years; range, 0.9-8.8 years; 381 357 person-years) were identified. Stress CMR yielded a DOR of 26.4 (95% CI, 10.6-65.9), a sensitivity of 81% (95% CI, 68%-89%), a specificity of 86% (95% CI, 75%-93%), and an AUROC of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77-0.89) for the detection of functionally obstructive coronary artery disease. In the subgroup analysis, stress CMR yielded higher diagnostic accuracy in the setting of suspected coronary artery disease (DOR, 53.4; 95% CI, 27.7-103.0) or when using 3-T imaging (DOR, 33.2; 95% CI, 19.9-55.4). The presence of stress-inducible ischemia was associated with higher all-cause mortality (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.69-2.31), CV mortality (OR, 6.40; 95% CI, 4.48-9.14), and MACEs (OR, 5.33; 95% CI, 4.04-7.04). The presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was associated with higher all-cause mortality (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.99-2.47), CV mortality (OR, 6.03; 95% CI, 2.76-13.13), and increased risk of MACEs (OR, 5.42; 95% CI, 3.42-8.60). After a negative test result, pooled AERs for CV death were less than 1.0%. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this study, stress CMR yielded high diagnostic accuracy and delivered robust prognostication, particularly when 3-T scanners were used. While inducible myocardial ischemia and LGE were associated with higher mortality and risk of MACEs, normal stress CMR results were associated with a lower risk of MACEs for at least 3.5 years.},

   abstract = {Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of myocardial diseases representing the first cause of heart transplantation in children. Diagnosing and classifying the different phenotypes can be challenging, particularly in this age group, where cardiomyopathies are often overlooked until the onset of severe symptoms. Cardiovascular imaging is crucial in the diagnostic pathway, from screening to classification and follow-up assessment. Several imaging modalities have been proven to be helpful in this field, with echocardiography undoubtedly representing the first imaging approach due to its low cost, lack of radiation, and wide availability. However, particularly in this clinical context, echocardiography may not be able to differentiate from cardiomyopathies with similar phenotypes and is often complemented with cardiovascular magnetic resonance. The latter allows a radiation-free differentiation between different phenotypes with unique myocardial tissue characterization, thus identifying the presence and extent of myocardial fibrosis. Nuclear imaging and computed tomography have a complementary role, although they are less used in daily clinical practice due to the concern related to the use of radiation in pediatric patients. However, these modalities may have some advantages in evaluating children with cardiomyopathies. This paper aims to review the strengths and limitations of each imaging modality in evaluating pediatric patients with suspected or known cardiomyopathies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In approximately 5-15% of all cases of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have unobstructed coronaries on angiography. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has proven useful to identify in most patients the underlying diagnosis associated with this presentation. However, the role of CMR to reclassify patients from the initial suspected condition has not been clarified. AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the proportion of patients with suspected MINOCA, or non-MINOCA, that CMR reclassifies with an alternative diagnosis from the original clinical suspicion. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort of patients in a tertiary cardiology centre was identified from a registry database. Patients who were referred for CMR for investigation of suspected MINOCA, and a diagnosis pre- and post-CMR was recorded to determine the proportion of diagnoses reclassified.A total of 888 patients were identified in the registry. CMR reclassified diagnosis in 78% of patients. Diagnosis of MINOCA was confirmed in only 243 patients (27%), whilst most patients had an alternative diagnosis (73%): myocarditis n = 217 (24%), Takotsubo syndrome n = 115 (13%), cardiomyopathies n = 97 (11%), normal CMR/non-specific n = 216 (24%). CONCLUSION: In a large single-centre cohort of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome and unobstructed coronary arteries, most patients had a non-MINOCA diagnosis (73%) (myocarditis, TakoTsubo, cardiomyopathies or normal CMR/non-specific findings), whilst only a minority had confirmed MINOCA (27%). Performing CMR led to reclassifying patients' diagnosis in 78% of cases, thus confirming its important clinical role and underscoring the clinical challenge in diagnosing MINOCA and non MINOCA conditions.},

   abstract = {Advances in cancer therapies have led to a global improvement in patient survival rates. Nevertheless, the price to pay is a concomitant increase in cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in this population. Increased inflammation and disturbances of the immune system are shared by both cancer and CV diseases. Immunological effects of anti-cancer treatments occur with both conventional chemotherapy and, to a greater extent, with novel biological therapies such as immunotherapy. For these reasons, there is growing interest in the immune system and its potential role at the molecular level in determining cardiotoxicity. Early recognition of these detrimental effects could help in identifying patients at risk and improve their oncological management. Non-invasive imaging already plays a key role in evaluating baseline CV risk and in detecting even subclinical cardiac dysfunction during surveillance. The aim of this review is to highlight the role of advanced cardiovascular imaging techniques in the detection and management of cardiovascular complications related to cancer treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The association between Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is debated. This study reappraises, after three pandemic years, the epidemiological data and the features of GBS in SARS-CoV-2 patients. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of case reports/series and cohort studies published between 1 January 2020 and 19 April 2023 was performed. RESULTS: In all, 209 case reports/series (304 patients) and 26 cohort studies were included. The risk of GBS in northern Italy during the first pandemic wave was 2.85 times increased (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54; 5.25) whereas in some countries the risk during the first pandemic year was 0.17 times reduced (risk ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.75; 0.93). The incidence of GBS in SARS-CoV-2 Italian hospitalized cohorts was 8.55 per 1000 (95% CI 5.33; 12.49) with an estimated incidence of 0.13 GBS per 1000 in the SARS-CoV-2 infected population. In European cohorts the pooled rate of GBS with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 61.3% of the total. GBS patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection showed more frequently, but not differently from non-infected patients, the classical clinical presentation and the demyelinating subtype. Cranial nerves were more frequently involved in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk of GBS occurred in northern Italy during early COVID-19 pandemic. The recognition of the 'Italian factor' reconciles contrasting results of the epidemiological studies. The slightly reduced GBS risk in other countries and the relatively high frequency of GBS associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection can be explained by the adopted health measures that decreased the circulation of other GBS infective antecedents.},

   abstract = {Whether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor is debated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the CV morbidity and mortality related to NAFLD in the general population, and to determine whether CV risk is comparable between lean and non-lean NAFLD phenotypes. We searched multiple databases, including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, for observational studies published through 2022 that reported the risk of CV events and mortality. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality, CV mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were assessed through random-effect meta-analysis. We identified 33 studies and a total study population of 10,592,851 individuals (mean age 53+/-8; male sex 50%; NAFLD 2, 9%). Mean follow-up was 10+/-6 years. Pooled ORs for all-cause and CV mortality were respectively 1.14 (95% CI, 0.78-1.67) and 1.13 (95% CI, 0.57-2.23), indicating no significant association between NAFLD and mortality. NAFLD was associated with increased risk of MI (OR 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.7), stroke (OR: 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1), atrial fibrillation (OR: 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3), and MACCE (OR: 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2). Compared with non-lean NAFLD, lean NAFLD was associated with increased CV mortality (OR: 1.50; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0), but similar all-cause mortality and risk of MACCE. While NAFLD may not be a risk factor for total and CV mortality, it is associated with excess risk of non-fatal CV events. Lean and non-lean NAFLD phenotypes exhibit distinct prognostic profiles and should receive equitable clinical care.},

   abstract = {Background: Most recent cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) can safely undergo a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scan under certain conditions, but metal artifacts may degrade image quality. The aim of this study was to assess the overall diagnostic yield of CMR and the extent of metal artifacts in a multicenter, multivendor study on CIED patients referred for CMR. Methods: We analyzed 309 CMR scans from 292 patients (age 57 &plusmn; 16 years, 219 male) with an MR-conditional pacemaker (n = 122), defibrillator (n = 149), or loop recorder (n = 38); CMR scans were performed in 10 centers from 2012 to 2020; MR-unsafe implants were excluded. Clinical and device parameters were recorded before and after the CMR scan. A visual analysis of metal artifacts was performed for each sequence on a segmental basis, based on a 5-point artifact score. Results: The vast majority of CMR scans (n = 255, 83%) were completely performed, while only 32 (10%) were interrupted soon after the first sequences and 22 (7%) were only partly acquired; CMR quality was non-diagnostic in 34 (11%) scans, poor (&lt;1/3 sequences were diagnostic) in 25 (8%), or acceptable (1/3 to 2/3 sequences were diagnostic) in 40 (13%), while most scans (n = 201, 68%) were of overall good quality. No adverse event or device malfunctioning occurred, and only nonsignificant changes in device parameters were recorded. The most affected sequences were SSFP (median score 0.32 [interquartile range 0.07&ndash;0.91]), followed by GRE (0.18 [0.02&ndash;0.59]) and LGE (0.14 [0.02&ndash;0.55]). ICDs induced more artifacts (median score in SSFP images 0.87 [0.50&ndash;1.46]) than PMs (0.11 [0.03&ndash;0.28]) or ILRs (0.11 [0.00&ndash;0.56]). Moreover, most artifacts were located in the anterior, anteroseptal, anterolateral, and apical segments of the LV and in the outflow tract of the RV. Conclusions: CMR is a versatile imaging technique, with a high safety profile and overall good image quality even in patients with MR-conditional CIEDs. Several strategies are now available to optimize image quality, substantially enhancing overall diagnostic yield.},

   abstract = {High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays have become the gold standard for diagnosing acute and chronic myocardial injury. The detection of troponin levels beyond the 99th percentile is included in the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction, specifically recommending the use of sex-specific thresholds. Measurable concentrations below the proposed diagnostic thresholds have been shown to inform prognosis in different categories of inpatients and outpatients. However, clinical investigations from the last twenty years have yielded conflicting results regarding the incremental value of using different cut-offs for men and women. While advocates of a sex-specific approach claim it may help reduce gender bias in cardiovascular medicine, particularly in acute coronary syndromes, other groups question the alleged incremental diagnostic and prognostic value of sex-specific thresholds, ultimately asserting that less is more. In the present review, we aimed to synthesize our current understanding of sex-based differences in cardiac troponin levels and to reappraise the available evidence with regard to (i) the prognostic significance of sex-specific diagnostic thresholds of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays compared to common cut-offs in both men and women undergoing cardiovascular disease risk assessment, and (ii) the clinical utility of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays for cardiovascular disease prevention in women.},

   abstract = {Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), or long COVID syndrome, is emerging as a major health issue in patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms commonly experienced by patients include fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, and "brain fog". Additionally, symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and syncope suggest the involvement of the autonomic nervous system. Signs of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction appear to be common in PASC and are similar to those observed in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and inappropriate sinus tachycardia. In this review, we report on the epidemiology of PASC, discuss current evidence and possible mechanisms underpinning the dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system, and suggest nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions to treat and relieve symptoms of PASC-associated dysautonomia.},

   abstract = {The myocardium is among the most energy-consuming tissues in the body, burning from 6 to 30 kg of ATP per day within the mitochondria, the so-called powerhouse of the cardiomyocyte. Although mitochondrial genetic disorders account for a small portion of cardiomyopathies, mitochondrial dysfunction is commonly involved in a broad spectrum of heart diseases, and it has been implicated in the development of heart failure via maladaptive circuits producing and perpetuating mitochondrial stress and energy starvation. In this bench-to-bedside review, we aimed to (i) describe the key functions of the mitochondria within the myocardium, including their role in ischemia/reperfusion injury and intracellular calcium homeostasis; (ii) examine the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction to multiple cardiac disease phenotypes and their transition to heart failure; and (iii) discuss the rationale and current evidence for targeting mitochondrial function for the treatment of heart failure, including via sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.},

   abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is increasingly recognized as a major global health problem. Intertwined with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease embraces a spectrum of liver conditions spanning from steatosis to inflammation, fibrosis, and liver failure. Compared with the general population, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is higher among nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients, in whom comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment is highly desirable. Preclinical effects of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease on the heart include both metabolic and structural changes eventually preceding overt myocardial dysfunction. Particularly, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with enhanced atherosclerosis, heart muscle disease, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias, with endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and oxidative stress playing in the background. In this topical review, we aimed to summarize current evidence on the epidemiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, discuss the pathophysiological links between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disease, illustrate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-related cardiovascular phenotypes, and finally provide a glimpse on the relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiac steatosis, mitochondrial (dys)function, and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction.},
